## Chapter 2: Positive Referendum Process
#### Article 5: Voting instrument in the General Referendum
Section 1: Liberland Merit and voting rules
The only form of voting instrument permitted for use in the Positive Referendum shall be politically pooled Liberland Merit (LLM).
A single LLM shall be usable in an open number of concurrent referenda and shall not require any cooldown period after voting in one referendum in order to be used in another referendum.
Section 2: Political Pooling and liquidity restrictions
Political pooling shall involve at least restricting the liquidity of LLM, such that they cannot be transferred to a different wallet. Political pooling shall in general last for an indefinite amount of time..
Political pooling will be reversible, but only at the rate of 10 percent per year, collectable in twelve instalments, each releasing one-twelfth of one-tenth of the Citizen’s politically pooled LLM balance.


Initiating the General Referendum
Any Citizen can  submit proposals for new or changed voting instruments or decisions they want to see enacted by the Referendum, henceforth “Proposal”. A Proposal submitted by a Citizen shall be known as a Citizen Proposal and the subsequent referendum shall be referred to as Citizen Referendum.
In addition, Congress in its entirety can vote on submitting a Proposal according to its rules of decision-making. When the Proposal passes the required quorum, it shall become a Congress Proposal and the subsequent referendum shall be referred to as Congress Referendum.
Procedurally, there shall be no difference between the Citizen Referenda and Congress Referenda, except for:
A Proposal Fee which shall only apply to a Citizen Proposal, which shall be established based on the current needs by the system and specified in a Regulation; and
In conformity with Art. 79 Section 1/2 of the Constitution, they shall differ in ways how the voting requirement is tallied.


Drafting a Proposal
To initiate a Positive Referendum, the Citizen or the Congress shall draft a Proposal in its final form. The draft shall be prepared to a professional standard.
The draft shall adhere strictly to the Legislative Rules of the Government, both in content and form.


Formal Requirements
Section 1: Documentary attachments
The Citizen or Congress shall attach to the Proposal the following documents: 
A comprehensive Regulatory Impact Assessment into the draft; and
A detailed Reasoning for each provision of the Proposal.
Both the Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) and the Explanation of individual articles (Reasoning) shall comply with the requirements set forth in the Legislative Rules of the Government.
Section 2: Additional information to be provided
The proposing party shall specify the category of the legal instrument being proposed, whether it be a law, regulation, or decision.
If the Proposal serves as an amendment, the Citizen or Congress shall identify the existing legal instrument or specific section thereof that the Proposal aims to amend.


Submitting a Proposal
The Citizen shall submit the Proposal under their own name and Congress shall select the option of a Congress Proposal. A proposing party shall make use of the designated form provided by the Government to realize the Proposal.
The Citizen proposing a Referendum shall pay the transaction fee and any additional fees as stipulated by the system at the time of submission.


Voting rules
All Citizens who possess at least 5000 politically pooled Liberland Merit (LLM) shall have the right to vote using their pooled LLM.
Each citizen is permitted to vote with only one single LLM balance and may vote only once per referendum.
In the event that a Citizen attempts to vote twice, the most recent vote shall supersede the earlier one.


Referendum Period
Section 1: Regular Referendum Period
Referendum shall take in general place over a period of 14 days, which shall be known as Referendum Period. 
A new Referendum will start immediately after the previous Referendum Period ends. Multiple Referenda may run concurrently within one Referendum Period.
A Referendum will take place during the Referendum Period immediately following the period in which the Sponsor submitted their Proposal.
Section 2: Shortened Referendum Period
Referenda originating from Congress may include a motion in their Proposal to shorten the Referendum Period to a minimum of three days. 
This motion must be justified by an urgent and present need where the life, liberty, and property of identifiable individuals are objectively at a high level of risk in the event of a delay. If included, this motion will be accepted; however, the resulting Referendum will be tallied as if it were based on a Popular Proposal.


Tallying the Vote
The outcome of the Referendum shall be determined based on the vote count at the moment the Referendum Period ends, that is, the last second of the Referendum Period for the given Referendum.

Voting Requirements
Section 1: Voting Requirements for Congress Proposals
The Voting Requirement for the passing of a Congress Proposal through a Referendum shall be to receive at least 50 percent plus one voting instrument indicating the voter desire that the Proposal should pass, henceforth “Approve” than there are voting instruments indicating the voter desire that the Proposal should fail, henceforth “Against”, upon the moment the votes are tallied.
Section 2: Voting Requirements for Citizen Proposals
The Voting Requirement for the passing of a Citizen Proposal through a Referendum shall be calculated by:
Dividing the votes for Approve by the square root of the total electorate,
Dividing the votes for Against by the square root of the actual turnout for this Referendum, and
Comparing the products of the two calculations.
Where the product from under 1., e.g., the votes approve divided by the square root of the total electorate, is higher by at least one than the product from under 2., e.g., the votes against, divided by the square root of the actual turnout for this Referendum; the Citizen Referendum shall succeed.


Enactment Period
Section 1: Regular Enactment Period
The Proposal will become legally binding after the completion of its Enactment Period. This period serves as the unified legisvacant period for all legal instruments enacted in Liberland and will last for an additional 14 days following the end of the Referendum Period.
During the Enactment Period, the Proposal may be vetoed by the Senate, just as it can be vetoed during the duration of the Referendum.
Section 2: Shortened Enactment Period
Congress Referenda may include a motion in their Proposals to either shorten this Enactment Period or eliminate it entirely.
This motion must be justified by an urgent and present need where the life, liberty, and property of identifiable individuals are objectively at a high level of risk in the event of a delay. 
This option to shorten the Enactment Period can be combined with the shortening of the Referendum Period and will likewise be accepted by the system when invoked, alone or in combination with the shortening of the Referendum Period.
Just like when the Referendum Period is shortened, a Referendum with a shortened Enactment Period will be tallied according to the rules for tallying Referenda based on Popular Proposals.


Quality control and Cancellation
Should the Proposal lack the requisite quality or omit the required Regulatory Impact Assessment, Reasoning or additional information as required by this law, Congress shall exercise its constitutional authority under Article 82 of the Constitution to cancel the Referendum, regardless of the merit of the Proposal’s content.
Insufficient quality or omission of the mandatory RIA or Reasoning  may also constitute a valid ground for cancellation initiated by the Senate.
The Supreme Court shall hear disputes where the quality control performing organ stands as the defendant and the dispute subject matter is the performance of the quality control.

Chapter 3: Negative Referendum Process
Proposing a Public Veto
A Citizen may initiate a Negative Referendum in the form of a Public Veto utilizing the tools provided for this purpose by the Government.
The Citizen shall specify:
The category of the legislative instrument targeted for revocation;
The year and number of the legislative instrument as recorded in the official government repository, serving as unique identifiers;
Where applicable, the articles and the exact words which are to be repealed.
A reasoned justification for the revocation;
Supporting evidence and documentation that demonstrates the legislative instrument’s continued legal force:
Poses a significant, clearly identified risk for Liberland or for the life, liberty, and property of identifiable individuals;
Results in habitual violations of the Non-Aggression Principle as defined in Article 7 of the Constitution;
Significantly undermines the classically liberal political orientation of Liberland.
Public Veto shall cost the same amount in Referendum Free as a Citizen-originated General Referendum.


Proposing a Dismissal
A Citizen may also initiate a Negative Referendum in the form of a Dismissal using the Government-provided tools.
The Citizen shall specify:
The category of the official targeted for dismissal;
The unique identifier of the official such as their LibID, publicly known Liberland Blockchain address or name and birth date in combination with their official address;
A reasoned justification for the dismissal;
References to evidence or documentation that clearly substantiates:
The official’s continued tenure poses a significant, clearly identified and present risk for Liberland or for the life, liberty, and property of identifiable individuals;
The official has habitually or severely acted against the life, liberty, or property of others, in violation of the Non-Aggression Principle as defined in Article 7 of the Constitution, and such actions have provably caused damage.


Duration and conditions of a Negative Referendum
Upon submitting the Proposal, it becomes a Negative Referendum immediately.
Unlike the Positive Referendum, the Negative Referendum shall run indefinitely until either the legislative instrument loses legal force by other means or the official is replaced on their position or until it succeeds.


Voting on a Negative Referendum
Voting on a Negative Referendum is conducted in the same system of electronic communication or, where the voting is done traditionally, using similar means as voting on a general Referendum; however, each Citizen has only one vote instead of their Voting Instrument balance.
Like when voting in a Positive Referendum, one can vote in multiple Negative Referenda running concurrently. Likewise, where one votes twice in one Negative Referendum, only the last voting attempt shall be counted such as when one votes in a General Referendum.


Voting Requirement for a Negative Referendum
In order for a Proposal within a Negative Referendum to be deemed successful, it shall require a minimum of 50 percent plus one vote of the total possible votes.


Consequences of a successful Public Veto
Where a piece of legislature is repealed, it shall lose legal force immediately. Where there are provisions in lower legislature dependent on this piece of legislature, these shall likewise lose legal force.
Congress and the Minister of Justice shall ensure that the Public Veto is realized without delay, unconditional and complete with all the consequences.
Where the Minister of Justice should delay or publish incorrect or incomplete information, the proposing Citizen may seek administrative recourse or, where this isn’t granted, a judicial recourse.


Consequences of a successful  Dismissal
Where an official is dismissed by a Dismissal, they shall immediately cease to hold the function from which they have been dismissed. This doesn’t in any way affect their future eligibility for a function, including the same function that they had been dismissed from.
To protect the integrity of the judicial system, a dismissed Judge shall remain in function for as long as necessary according to the rules of their Court to finish their actively assigned cases; the Court shall not assign any more new cases to the dismissed Judge after the dismissal. 
The Parties in a Case where a dismissed Judge is active shall have the right to replace the Judge, but such a motion must be submitted unanimously. The Court shall in case this motion is submitted according to this Law replace the dismissed Judge with another Judge of comparable qualifications who is not dismissed.


Quality control and Cancellation
Negative Referendum Proposals that lack one or more of the required elements or are of manifestly unprofessional quality shall be subject to cancellation by Congress pursuant to Article 82 of the Constitution.
Such deficiencies may also serve as grounds for cancellation initiated by the Senate.
The Supreme Court shall hear disputes where the quality control performing organ stands as the defendant and the dispute subject matter is the performance of the quality control.
Chapter 4: Institutions and final provisions
Blockchain system
The conduct of Referenda shall be facilitated through electronic means, utilizing a public blockchain system designed to accommodate governance functions.
The blockchain system shall adhere to internationally accepted standards concerning election security, privacy, identification, and transparency in vote counting.
Government responsibility to establish the Blockchain system
The Government is responsible for either establishing or adopting a system that fulfills the requirements set forth by the Constitution and this Law, and shall ensure its regular maintenance.
The system shall be designed to be sufficiently decentralized and secure to mitigate risks of unauthorized interference, while maintaining user-friendliness to facilitate ease of use by the majority of Citizens.


User-friendly interface
The user interface shall be intuitive, allowing Citizens to:
Propose and vote in Referenda;
Monitor Referendum and Enactment Periods, including adjustments in duration;
Access historical Referendum data.
For each Referendum, the interface must display:
Referendum title;
Required documents, including RIA and Reasoning for Positive Referenda;
Classification of legislative instruments for Positive Referenda;
Identification of instruments or parts thereof for Amendments or Repeals;
Necessary details for Negative Referenda, such as Public Veto or Dismissal reasons;
Referendum origin;
Proposer's identity in Citizen Referenda;
Voting prerequisites;
Current vote tally; and
Active or past Referendum and Enactment Periods."
