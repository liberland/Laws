NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ENACTED by the Parliament of Liberland.
   
### Title 1: Referendum

#### Article 1: Primary Instrument of Democracy
##### Section 1: Purpose of the Referendum
1. The Referendum, as the primary instrument of democracy in Liberland, shall empower Citizens to make collective decisions and to enact 

   a) Constitutional Ammendments, 

   b) Laws

   c) other types of Regulations

   d) decisions in individual cases, including ones about the blockchain system; and 

   e) to ratify the international treaties of the highest importance. 

2. The Referendum shall be open to participation by all citizens.

##### Section 2: Supremacy of the Referendum
1. The Referendum shall be the paramount decision-making process within Liberland and the Government, and no other decision-making process shall have the authority to overturn a Referendum decision.
2. As the Executive Power is accountable to the Legislative Power, the Referendum may supersede and replace any other decision-making process within the Legislative or Executive branches of the Government.
3. However, the Referendum shall not directly overturn a judicial decision. Instead, it may shape matters within the Judiciary by enacting Laws. The Referendum shall only influence the Guardians of the Republic through Constitutional Amendments and to the extent that Dismissal, as prescribed by the Constitution, permits.

#### Article 2: Blockchain System
##### Section 1: Implementation of the Referendum
1. The Referendum shall be conducted through electronic communications using a public blockchain system capable of hosting governance, henceforth the "Blockchain".
2. The system shall be sufficiently decentralized and secure to minimize risks of unauthorized tampering of all kinds, and user-friendly enough to ensure that the vast majority of Citizens can operate it with ease.

##### Section 2: Government procures the Blockchain
The Government shall ensure the establishment or adoption of a system capable of meeting the requirements of this Law and shall provide for its regular maintenance.

#### Article 3: Voting Instruments
##### Section 1: Voting Mechanism
1. Voting in the Referendum shall generally be conducted using Liberland Merits (LLM) as voting instruments, which Citizens shall be able to purchase on the open market.
2. The Public Veto, a special form of the Referendum as prescribed by the Constitution, shall also be organized for matters required therein. The Public Veto shall include the options of voting on Dismissal of Judges, the President, and the Vice-Presidents.

##### Section 2: Politically Pooled LLM
The only form of LLM permitted for use in Referenda shall be politically pooled LLM. Political pooling involves restricting the liquidity of LLM, such that they cannot be transferred to a different wallet for the duration of the political pooling.

#### Article 4: Referendum Period
The Referendum Period shall be 14 days. At the end of the Referendum period in which a Proposal has been converted into a Referendum, the Proposal is either Approved or Rejected based on whether a sufficient amount of voting instruments were cast for acceptance, henceforth "Voting Requirement".

### Title 2: Proposals

#### Article 5: Making Proposals

##### Section 1: Submission of Proposals

To initiate a Referendum, a proposal must be submitted using the Blockchain system as prescribed by this Law.

##### Section 2: Citizen Proposals

Any Citizen may submit a Proposal in the system, in which case the origin of the Proposal shall be registered as "Citizen."

##### Section 3: Congress Proposals

The Congress may collectively submit a Proposal in the system, in which case the origin of the Proposal shall be registered as"Congress." 

#### Article 6: Endorsing Proposals

Any Citizen may support any Proposal by pledging their voting instrument into it. A Citizen can use the same voting instrument in multiple referenda active at the same time.

#### Article 7: View of Proposals

The system shall provide a view in which all active Proposals are listed. This view shall include the following data:

   a) Name of the Proposal;
   
   b) Origin of the Proposal;
   
   c) Link to the personal page of the Citizen or Congress Member who made the Proposal;
   
   d) Rate of Endorsement;
   
   e) Proposed Enactment Period; and
   
   f) Date on which the Proposal was made.

#### Article 8: Converting Proposals into Referenda

##### Section 1: Selection Algorithm

The system shall incorporate an algorithm that selects a Proposal at the beginning of each Referendum Period to be converted into a Referendum.

##### Section 2: Cycling Between Origins

The algorithm will alternate between the Citizen and Congress Origins, starting with the Congress Origin, so that in odd Periods, a Proposal is selected from the Citizen Origin and in even Periods, a Proposal is selected from the Congress Origin.

##### Section 3: Selection Criteria

The algorithm shall always select the most endorsed Proposal per given Origin for conversion.

### Title 3: Voting on Referenda

#### Article 9: Voting

All Citizens shall have the right to vote using their LLM. Citizens may vote multiple times for the same Referendum, with each subsequent vote replacing the previous one.

#### Article 10: Deciding Referenda

1. The system shall determine the outcome of the Referendum based on the vote count at the moment the Referendum Period ends, comparing the result with the Voting Requirement required for approval based on the given origin.
2. If the Voting Requirement is reached, the Referendum concludes with the Approval of the Proposal, and the Enactment Period begins.
3. If the Voting Requirement is not reached, the Referendum concludes with the Rejection of the Proposal, which is then discarded.

#### Article 11: Voting Requirement

The following shall be the Referendum voting requirements for the general Referendum required for the Referendum to Adopt the Proposal:

   a) For the origin Citizen, the Voting Requirement shall be calculated as the number of votes against divided by the square root of the turnout must be smaller than the number of votes approve divided by the square root of the electorate, henceforth referred to as "Super-Majority Approve".
   
   b) For the origin Congress, the Voting Requirement shall be calculated as the simple majority of the votes cast, henceforth referred to as "Simple Majority".
   
#### Article 12: View of Voting

The system shall provide a view in which all active Referenda are listed. This view shall include the following data:

   a) Name of the Referendum;
   
   b) Origin of the Referendum;
   
   c) Link to the personal page of the Citizen or Congress Member who made the original Proposal;
   
   d) Voting Requirement required for the Adoption of a Proposal;
   
   e) Current Votes; and
   
   f) Relevant Referendum Period.

#### Article 13: Enactment Period

The Proposal shall gain legal force after its Enactment Period has run its course. The Proposal may be vetoed during that time by the Senate using Cancellation or by Citizens using Public Veto.

### Title 4: Public Veto

#### Article 14: Proposing a Public Veto

1. A Public Veto may be proposed by a Citizen by bonding 1000 LLM into the Proposal. The Proposal shall be admissible on a:

   a) Regulation or an Adopted Referendum in the Enactment Period phase; or
   
   b) An elected official, a Judge, Vice-President, or the President.

2. Upon submitting the Proposal, it becomes a Referendum at the beginning of the next Referendum Period.

#### Article 15: Voting on a Public Veto

Voting on a Public Veto is conducted in the same manner as voting on a general Referendum, but each Citizen may only use one LLM for each Public Veto. The voting requirement shall be 50 percent plus one vote to effect the Public Veto.
