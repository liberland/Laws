     a. A Proposal Fee which shall only apply to a Citizen Proposal, which shall be established based on the current needs by the system and specified in a                Regulation; and
   
     b. In conformity with Art. 79 Section 1/2 of the Constitution, they shall differ in ways how the voting requirement is tallied.

##### Section 2: Shortened Referendum Period
1. Referenda originating from Congress may include a motion in their Proposal to shorten the Referendum Period to a minimum of three days. 
2. This motion must be justified by an urgent and present need where the life, liberty, and property of identifiable individuals are objectively at a high level of risk in the event of a delay. If included, this motion will be accepted; however, the resulting Referendum will be tallied as if it were based on a Popular Proposal.

#### Article 12: Tallying the Vote
The outcome of the Referendum shall be determined based on the vote count at the moment the Referendum Period ends, that is, the last second of the Referendum Period for the given Referendum.

#### Article 13: Voting Requirements
##### Section 1: Voting Requirements for Congress Proposals
The Voting Requirement for the passing of a Congress Proposal through a Referendum shall be to receive at least 50 percent plus one voting instrument indicating the voter desire that the Proposal should pass, henceforth “Approve” than there are voting instruments indicating the voter desire that the Proposal should fail, henceforth “Against”, upon the moment the votes are tallied.

##### Section 2: Voting Requirements for Citizen Proposals

    b. Dividing the votes for Against by the square root of the actual turnout for this Referendum, and
   
    c. Comparing the products of the two calculations.
   
3. Where the product from under 1., e.g., the votes approve divided by the square root of the total electorate, is higher by at least one than the product from under 2., e.g., the votes against, divided by the square root of the actual turnout for this Referendum; the Citizen Referendum shall succeed.

#### Article 14: Enactment Period
##### Section 1: Regular Enactment Period
1. The Proposal will become legally binding after the completion of its Enactment Period. This period serves as the unified legisvacant period for all legal instruments enacted in Liberland and will last for an additional 14 days following the end of the Referendum Period.
2. During the Enactment Period, the Proposal may be vetoed by the Senate, just as it can be vetoed during the duration of the Referendum.

##### Section 2: Shortened Enactment Period
1. Congress Referenda may include a motion in their Proposals to either shorten this Enactment Period or eliminate it entirely.
2. This motion must be justified by an urgent and present need where the life, liberty, and property of identifiable individuals are objectively at a high level of risk in the event of a delay. 
3. This option to shorten the Enactment Period can be combined with the shortening of the Referendum Period and will likewise be accepted by the system when invoked, alone or in combination with the shortening of the Referendum Period.
4. Just like when the Referendum Period is shortened, a Referendum with a shortened Enactment Period will be tallied according to the rules for tallying Referenda based on Popular Proposals.

#### Article 15: Quality control and Cancellation
1. Should the Proposal lack the requisite quality or omit the required Regulatory Impact Assessment, Reasoning or additional information as required by this law, Congress shall exercise its constitutional authority under Article 82 of the Constitution to cancel the Referendum, regardless of the merit of the Proposal’s content.

## Chapter 3: Democratic Veto Process
#### Article 16: Proposing a Public Veto

    c. Where applicable, the articles and the exact words which are to be repealed.

    d. A reasoned justification for the revocation;

    e. Supporting evidence and documentation that demonstrates the legislative instrument’s continued legal force:

        i. Poses a significant, clearly identified risk for Liberland or for the life, liberty, and property of identifiable individuals;

        ii. Results in habitual violations of the Non-Aggression Principle as defined in Article 7 of the Constitution;

        iii. Significantly undermines the classically liberal political orientation of Liberland.

3. Public Veto shall cost the same amount in Referendum Free as a Citizen-originated Meritocratic Referendum.

2. The Citizen shall specify:

     a. The category of the official targeted for dismissal;

     b. The unique identifier of the official such as their LibID, publicly known Liberland Blockchain address or name and birth date in combination with their            official address;

     c. A reasoned justification for the dismissal;
 
     d. References to evidence or documentation that clearly substantiates:
   
        i. The official’s continued tenure poses a significant, clearly identified and present risk for Liberland or for the life, liberty, and property of identifiable individuals;

        ii. The official has habitually or severely acted against the life, liberty, or property of others, in violation of the Non-Aggression Principle as defined in Article 7 of the Constitution, and such actions have provably caused damage.

#### Article 18: Duration and conditions of a Democratic Veto

#### Article 19: Voting on a Democratic Veto
1. Voting on a Democratic Veto is conducted in the same system of electronic communication or, where the voting is done traditionally, using similar means as voting on a Meritocratic Referendum; however, each Citizen has only one vote instead of their Voting Instrument balance.
2. Like when voting in a Meritocratic Referendum, one can vote in multiple Negative Referenda running concurrently. Likewise, where one votes twice in one Democratic Veto, only the last voting attempt shall be counted such as when one votes in a Meritocratic Referendum.

#### Article 20: Voting Requirement for a Democratic Veto
In order for a Proposal within a Democratic Veto to be deemed successful, it shall require a minimum of 50 percent plus one vote of the total possible votes.

#### Article 21: Consequences of a successful Public Veto
1. Where a piece of legislature is repealed, it shall lose legal force immediately. Where there are provisions in lower legislature dependent on this piece of legislature, these shall likewise lose legal force.
2. Congress and the Minister of Justice shall ensure that the Public Veto is realized without delay, unconditional and complete with all the consequences.
3. Where the Minister of Justice should delay or publish incorrect or incomplete information, the proposing Citizen may seek administrative recourse or, where this isn’t granted, a judicial recourse.

#### Article 22: Consequences of a successful  Dismissal
1. Where an official is dismissed by a Dismissal, they shall immediately cease to hold the function from which they have been dismissed. This doesn’t in any way affect their future eligibility for a function, including the same function that they had been dismissed from.
2. To protect the integrity of the judicial system, a dismissed Judge shall remain in function for as long as necessary according to the rules of their Court to finish their actively assigned cases; the Court shall not assign any more new cases to the dismissed Judge after the dismissal. 
3. The Parties in a Case where a dismissed Judge is active shall have the right to replace the Judge, but such a motion must be submitted unanimously. The Court shall in case this motion is submitted according to this Law replace the dismissed Judge with another Judge of comparable qualifications who is not dismissed.

#### Article 23: Quality control and Cancellation
1. Democratic Veto Proposals that lack one or more of the required elements or are of manifestly unprofessional quality shall be subject to cancellation by Congress pursuant to Article 82 of the Constitution.
2. Such deficiencies may also serve as grounds for cancellation initiated by the Senate.
