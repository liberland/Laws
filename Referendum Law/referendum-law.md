       i.   Laws;

##### Section 2: Participation in the Referendum
The Referendum shall be open to participation by all Citizens 15 years of age or older.

##### Section 3: Referendum Supremacy
1. The Referendum shall be the decision-making process of the highest authority within Liberland and the Government; therefore, no other decision-making process shall have the authority to overturn a Referendum decision once it is made.
2. As the Executive Power must remain accountable to the Legislative Power, the Referendum may supersede and replace any other decision-making process within the Legislative or Executive branches of the Government.

4. The Referendum shall only influence the workings of the Senate through Constitutional Amendments and international Treaties and to the extent to which Art. 76/2 of the Constitution permits this.

#### Article 2: Forms of the Referendum

       i.  President or the Vice-President,
   
       ii. Congress,
   
       iii.Senate, or

##### Section 1: Drafting of Proposal

2. Each citizen is permitted to vote with only one single LLM balance and may vote only once per referendum.

##### Section 2: Shortened Referendum Period
1. Referenda originating from Congress may include a motion in their Proposal to shorten the Referendum Period to a minimum of three days. 
2. This motion must be justified by an urgent and present need where the life, liberty, and property of identifiable individuals are objectively at a high level of risk in the event of a delay. If included, this motion will be accepted; however, the resulting Referendum will be tallied as if it were based on a Popular Proposal.

#### Article 8: Tallying and Voting Requirements

##### Section 1: Tallying the Votes
The outcome of the Referendum shall be determined based on the vote count at the moment the Referendum Period ends, that is, the last second of the last minute of the last hour of the last day of the Referendum Period for the given Referendum.

##### Section 2: Voting Requirements for Congress Proposals
The Voting Requirement for the passing of a Congress Proposal through a Referendum shall be to receive at least 50 percent plus one voting instrument indicating the voter desire that the Proposal should pass, henceforth “Approve” than there are voting instruments indicating the voter desire that the Proposal should fail, henceforth “Against”, upon the moment the votes are tallied.

##### Section 3: Voting Requirements for Citizen Proposals
1. The Voting Requirement for the passing of a Citizen Proposal through a Referendum shall be calculated by:
   
    a) Dividing the votes for Approve by the square root of the total electorate,

    b) Dividing the votes for Against by the square root of the actual turnout for this Referendum, and
   
    c) Comparing the products of the two calculations.
   
3. Where the product from under 1., e.g., the votes approve divided by the square root of the total electorate, is higher by at least one than the product from under 2., e.g., the votes against, divided by the square root of the actual turnout for this Referendum; the Citizen Referendum shall succeed.

#### Article 9: Enactment Period

##### Section 1: Regular Enactment Period
1. The Proposal will become legally binding after the completion of its Enactment Period. This period serves as the unified legisvacant period for all legal instruments enacted in Liberland and will last for an additional 14 days following the end of the Referendum Period.
2. During the Enactment Period, the Proposal may be vetoed by the Senate, just as it can be vetoed during the duration of the Referendum.

##### Section 2: Shortened Enactment Period
1. Referenda initiated by Congress may include a motion in their Proposals to either shorten this Enactment Period or eliminate it entirely.
2. This motion must be justified by an urgent and present need where the life, liberty, and property of identifiable individuals are objectively at a high level of risk in the event of a delay. 
3. This option to shorten the Enactment Period can be combined with the shortening of the Referendum Period and will likewise be accepted by the system when invoked, alone or in combination with the shortening of the Referendum Period.
4. Just like when the Referendum Period is shortened, a Referendum with a shortened Enactment Period will be tallied according to the rules for tallying Referenda based on Popular Proposals.

    c) A reasoned justification for the dismissal;
   
    d) References to evidence or documentation that clearly substantiates:
   
      i.  The official’s continued tenure poses a significant, clearly identified and present risk for Liberland or for the life, liberty, and property of identifiable individuals;
   
      ii. The official has habitually or severely acted against the life, liberty, or property of others, in violation of the Non-Aggression Principle as defined in Article 7 of the Constitution, and such actions have provably caused damage.

##### Section 3: Quality Control and Cancellation
1. Negative Referendum Proposals that lack one or more of the required elements or are of manifestly unprofessional quality shall be subject to cancellation by Congress pursuant to Article 82 of the Constitution.

#### Article 14: Consequences of a Negative Referendum decision that passes

##### Section 1: Consequences of a Public Veto
1. Where a piece of legislature is repealed, it shall lose legal force immediately. Where there are provisions in lower legislature dependent on this piece of legislature, these shall likewise lose legal force.
2. The Minister of Justice will ensure that this is administered and the decision is published without delay and complete with all the consequences.
3. Where the Minister of Justice should delay or publish incorrect or incomplete information, the Sponsor may seek administrative recourse or, where this isn’t granted, a judicial recourse.

##### Section 2: Consequences of a Dismissal
Where an official is dismissed by a Dismissal, they shall immediately cease to hold the function from which they have been dismissed. This doesn’t in any way affect their future eligibility for a function, including the same function that they had been dismissed from.
