2. The Settlement shall be led by one Settlement Director and managed by additional personnel as deemed necessary by the Director. All individuals actively serving the Settlement as an organisation, as opposed to those merely involved in the Settlement as an effort, shall be considered Agents of the Government.
3. Those who are contracted within the Settlement by a contract according to this Law or simply present as Settlers according to this law, in either case without being formally included in the hierarchy of the organization of the Settlement, shall not be Agents of the Government but simply independent contractors.

##### Purpose of the Settlement
1. The primary purpose of the Settlement is to develop the first inhabited areas of Liberland, facilitating the establishment of residences and the provision of goods and services by Citizens and, occasionally, other individuals within the territory of Liberland.
2. The secondary purpose of the Settlement is to assist in securing Liberland's international recognition.

#### Article 2: Settlement Effort

Such a Settler shall be regarded as a volunteer or helper and shall not hold the status of an employee, contractor, part-time worker, or any other position entitled to expect any profit or revenue from Liberland, whether directly or indirectly.
