# Delict Law

## Preamble
In the pursuit of justice, the Free Republic of Liberland enacts this legislation to establish the Delict Process, embodying our commitment to the principles of liberty, transparency, and the Rule of Law. This law is designed to adjudicate matters of guilt and innocence, ensure the imposition of equitable penalties, and facilitate the restitution of victims, all while upholding economic prudence and the sanctity of due process. Through this framework, Liberland reaffirms its dedication to safeguarding the rights and liberties of its citizens, fostering a just, efficient, and transparent judicial system.

## Recitals
Whereas the establishment of the Rule of Law is predicated upon the foundation of a robust legal framework;

Whereas the enforcement of the Rule of Law mandates a precise and unequivocal definition of Delicts, alongside the criteria for their perpetration;

Whereas it is a cardinal tenet that no person shall be adjudged guilty of a Delict without a specific and pre-established legal foundation;

Whereas Delicts are recognized within the Constitution as well as in the jurisprudential doctrines of contemporary civilized nations;

Whereas in such nations, Delicts are organized in a hierarchical structure, with the severity of punishment escalating in correspondence to the increasing threat posed to society;

Whereas the Constitution categorizes Crimes as the gravest form of Delicts, necessitating distinct prosecutorial strategies;

Whereas there exists a coherent and stable theoretical framework utilized by nations surrounding Liberland, which delineates the accountability for Delicts and mandates specific prosecutorial approaches, and which is imperative to integrate within the legal system of Liberland;

Whereas the notion of liability for omissions, as well as for the commission of a Delict, must be recognized, thereby enabling the sanctioning of all detrimental actions legislatively defined as Delicts;

Whereas the codification of intent, alongside culpability through negligence, is essential to cover the full spectrum of human delictual behavior;

Whereas provisions concerning co-perpetratorship must be articulated, ensuring that co-perpetrators are duly recognized for their respective degrees of responsibility, thereby preventing the evasion of punishment or the imposition of unduly harsh penalties;

Whereas the accountability of legal entities for Delicts constitutes a fundamental principle in jurisdictions akin to ours, representing a modern trend essential for comprehensively addressing the complexities of contemporary society and delinquent behavior;

Whereas the enumeration of sanctions within statutory law is imperative to uphold the principle of nulla poena sine lege;

Whereas there ought to be a standardized criterion for sanctioning, wherein pecuniary penalties, including their minimum and maximum limits, serve as a primary metric for gauging the gravity of Delicts in jurisdictions similar to ours;

Whereas the innovative utilization of blockchain technology and Liberland's distinctive citizenship model—wherein a citizen fundamentally acts as a stakeholder in the state's corporate entity—enables the direct deduction from one's share as an effective punitive and deterrent mechanism;

Whereas the voluntary remittance of deductions may, in numerous instances, be regarded as an act of civic contrition, embodying elements of guilt acknowledgment and reparative justice towards the state;

Whereas it is of paramount importance to facilitate restitution to the victim in a manner that minimizes administrative encumbrances, thereby prioritizing the victim's compensation as a foremost sanction;

Whereas auxiliary sanctions, such as the prohibition of specific activities or the seizure of items likely to be employed in the recurrence of Delicts, may occasionally serve a beneficial purpose;

Whereas distinct relationships of special accountability and discipline vis-à-vis the State or a State apparatus necessitate unique categories of Delicts and sanctions reflective of this unique duty, including those arising from employment or quasi-employment relations, aiming to maintain the high standard of services expected by the citizens of Liberland and its affiliated organizations;

Whereas victims necessitate a distinguished status and entitlements to ensure their complete restitution, they shall be granted a unique procedural standing as a full Party within the Delict Process, with such standing being obligatory in instances where damages arise from a Delict;

Whereas certain fundamental principles underpin a just Delict procedure, principles that are universally recognized and particularly observed within jurisdictions both comparable and proximate to Liberland, these principles must be codified to render the process just, transparent, and conducive to the endorsement of Liberland’s international counterparts;

Whereas the presumption of innocence remains a cornerstone of justice, universally and in comparable nations, ensuring that the accused is deemed innocent in all societal aspects until a Final Verdict (or a Delict Order) is judicially affirmed;

Whereas no individual shall be compelled to self-incriminate or to incriminate close family members;

Whereas the right to a fair hearing for each Party must be upheld by all adjudicating bodies involved in a Delict procedure, and thus must be operationalized within this legislation;

Whereas the entitlement to be informed of, to confront, and to cross-examine one’s accuser is a practice widely upheld in jurisdictions akin to Liberland and therefore shall be adopted by Liberland;

Whereas the Accused shall be acknowledged as enduring significant distress, irrespective of eventual guilt or innocence, and thus is deserving of protection; given that the state of being accused engenders considerable stress, limitations, and uncertainty regarding the veracity of the allegations until the issuance of a final adjudication; consequently, the Accused shall be afforded expedited procedural rights.

Whereas the methods utilized within the Delict Process shall be commensurate with its paramount aim, namely the ascertainment of guilt and innocence;

Whereas the execution of the Delict Process must adhere rigorously to statutory mandates and constraints, ensuring that every phase not only conforms to legal standards but also presents as equitable and orderly to an impartial third-party observer.

Whereas the dignity of the accused shall never be compromised despite the goals of the Delict Process. The Accused shall never be used as mere means to discover their guilt or innocent, let alone to punish them.
Whereas the epitome of effective justice is its prompt dispensation, necessitating that the initial phase of the Delict Process be significantly streamlined to include only the assessment of guilt's likelihood and the issuance of a Delict Order upon a reasonable establishment of culpability;
Whereas notwithstanding the urgency and necessity for expedient resolution, it is imperative that in instances where there exists profound and substantive disputes between the plaintiff and the defendant, only the judiciary has the authority to adjudicate such matters;

Whereas in Liberland, it is imperative that the administration of justice also extends its fairness to the State's finances, which are accrued through the voluntary contributions of its citizens, thereby distinguishing Liberland from other nations in terms of the significance attached to court costs and the efficiency of legal proceedings;
Whereas, in the event of litigation resulting in a loss for the State, it bears the financial burdens thereof, necessitating that the determination of a case's potential success be approached with rigorous economic prudence as mandated by law;
Whereas the Court stands as the paramount institution for adjudication within Liberland, with the General Process serving as the foundational procedural framework from which all specialized procedures are derived, thereby necessitating that the procedure concerning Delicts also originates from this General Process;

Whereas the institution of specialized procedures must be clearly articulated within statutory law, this legislation hereby enacts the Delict Process as the specialized procedural framework tasked with adjudicating issues related to the ascertainment of guilt or innocence, the imposition of sanctions on the guilty, and the provision of restitution to victims;

Whereas the evidentiary threshold for decisions on guilt, innocence, and sentencing must be elevated to the standard of "beyond reasonable doubt";

Whereas the reasonable expectations and legal certainty of all parties, including the Accused, must be safeguarded, thus once initiated, the reclassification of a Delict to a more severe category shall be restricted to Crimes and certain exceptional instances, with further constraints to protect reasonable expectations;

Whereas distinct procedures must be established at the intersection of ordinary Delicts and Crimes, with adequate protections in place for instances where reclassification to a Crime is subsequently deemed unwarranted;

Whereas these procedures necessitate a tailored approach that builds upon the solid foundation of Romanist and EU legal traditions, with occasional reference to Anglo-American jurisprudence, including specific applications of legal principles such as the substitution of parties, withdrawal of a party, or legal representation;

Whereas the process must be expedited and streamlined, focusing on achieving the end goal with utmost diligence and quality, thus rendering the Written Process an exception and centering the court proceedings around the Trial;

Whereas Mediation shall not be incorporated into the Delict Process due to the inherent authority disparity between the parties, yet Liberland's unwavering commitment to liberty shall be maintained through the adaptation of the Plea Bargain mechanism, imbued with a distinctive Liberlandian essence;

Whereas the verdict within the Delict Process must remain solely concentrated on issues of guilt, punishment, restitution, and court costs, unswayed by external objectives;

Whereas Appeals shall also focus exclusively on matters of guilt, punishment, and restitution, permissible solely on these grounds, with the principle of legal certainty stipulating that the Appeal should not generally worsen the accused's situation, except in cases where a non-Crime is reclassified as a Crime, wherein the accused's protections still apply;

Whereas acknowledging the inherent stress and authority involved in being the Accused, and the significant consequences of an unjust verdict, the Supreme Court is mandated to prioritize Delict, and especially Criminal cases, where there exists a potential for such injustice.

# Book 1: Substantive Delict Law
## Chapter 1: General provisions
### Title 1: Delict

#### Article 1: Definition of Delict
A Delict is defined as a human action that:

   a. breaches the Non-Aggression Principle, 
   
   b. causes an identifiable harm to another person or the interests of the State;
   
   c. violates a legal provision or a provision in the Constitution; and
   
   d. this codex or a special codex prescribes a punishment for the violation of the given legal provision.

#### Article 2: Liberland jurisdiction over Delicts
1. Liberland shall seek out and punish whosoever seems likely to have commited a Delict, henceforth ´Perpetrator´, where
   
    a. The harm or the predominant aspect of the act occurs within the jurisdiction of Liberland;
   
    b. The Delict directly involves as the suspected Perpetrator an individual or entity subject to Liberland's jurisdiction;
   
    c. Other cases of Delict, most notably where one of the victims is an individual or entity subject to Liberland´s jurisdiction or the State; where
   
       i. The standing public international law allows for the attribution of Delict jurisdiction to Liberland; and
   
       ii. The taking up of the jurisdiction is in the interest of Liberland.

#### Article 3: Perpetrator and Culpability
##### Section 1: Individual Perpetrator´s Culpability
An individual shall be recognized as a Perpetrator of a Delict if their actions fulfill the constituent elements of a Delict as defined by Law. This fulfillment confirms the individual's Culpability for the Delict.

##### Section 2: Intentional Culpability
1. Intentional Culpability shall be established where the Perpetrator
    a. Intended to violate or endanger an interest protected by law; or
    b. Knew that their actions could violate or endanger an interest protected by law, and was willing to accept that risk. 
2. Intentional Culpability shall be deemed sufficient for establishing the identity of the Perpetrator in all Delicts.

##### Section 3: Culpability by Negligence
1. Culpability can arise from gross negligence, in addition to intentional actions. Gross negligence occurs when the Perpetrator knew that their actions could violate or endanger an interest protected by law, but without reasonable grounds relied on not violating or endangering that interest. 
2. Gross negligence shall be sufficient to establish culpability for any Delict.
3. Culpability also includes unintentional negligence. This happens when the Perpetrator did not know that their actions could violate or endanger an interest protected by law, but should and could have known given the circumstances and their personal situation. The Law will detail when unintentional negligence leads to culpability.

#### Article 4: Co-Perpetrator
1. If a Delict or its attempt was committed by the intentional joint conduct of two or more individuals, each is liable as if they had committed the Delict alone.
2. If the Delict was committed by joint conduct of two or more entities, of which at least one is a legal person or a self-employed individual, each is liable as if they had committed the Delict alone.

#### Article 5: Assisting the Perpetrator
##### Section 1: Planning, Instigation, Enablement
The term "Perpetrator" shall also encompass any individual who, with intent, engages in any of the following acts:

   a. Planning or directing the commission of a Delict, herein referred to as the "Organizer";
   
   b. Instigating another individual to decide to commit a Delict, herein referred to as the "Inciter";
   
   c. Enabling or facilitating the commission of a Delict by another individual, herein referred to as the "Accomplice";
      provided that the Delict is either completed or its attempt is deemed punishable under this Law.

##### Section 2: Applicability of Co-Perpetration
1. An Accomplice shall be regarded as a Perpetrator unless explicitly provided otherwise by applicable law.
2. The prescribed sanction for an Organizer, Inciter, or Accomplice shall align with the scope and range of sanctions established for the principal Perpetrator. However, the actual sanction imposed may be adjusted, either reduced or, in exceptional circumstances, increased, in accordance with the respective degrees of culpability attributed to each such Perpetrator.

##### Section 3: Using another individual or entity
1. An individual who, for the purpose of committing a Delict, employs the use of another individual, who is not legally liable for the Delict due to the presence of any circumstances negating culpability as stipulated in this Law, shall be deemed the sole Perpetrator of the Delict.
2. In cases where an individual employs a legal entity for the commission of a Delict, and where such legal entity is not itself liable for the Delict under the law, the said individual shall be regarded as the Delict's Perpetrator.

### Title 2: Conditions of Liability for Delicts
#### Article 6: Omission
For the purposes of this law, "conduct" also includes the omission of such action to which the actor was obligated pursuant to another legal regulation or official decision, resulting from a voluntarily assumed duty to law or if his special obligation arose from his previous endangering conduct, or for which he was obligated for another reason based on the circumstances and his conditions.

#### Article 7: Attempted Delict
1. An attempt to commit a Delict shall be subject to punishment in accordance with the provisions applicable to a completed Delict. However, the severity of the punishment may be reduced, taking into account the specific circumstances of the attempt. 
2. An individual may avert liability for an attempted Delict by voluntarily abandoning the attempt and effectively restoring the situation to its state prior to the commencement of the attempt, provided that no harm has been caused to any victim. 
3. In cases where harm has occurred, the degree of culpability and the severity of the punishment may be mitigated if the individual makes efforts to restore the situation to its prior state, compensates the victim, and voluntarily reports the act to the Watch.

#### Article 8: Continuing, Persistent and Collective Delict

##### Section 1: Continuing Delict
1. A Continuing Delict is committed by actions that, through individual but connected acts driven by a unified intent, fulfill the elements of the same Delict. 
2. These actions must demonstrate a similarity or identity in method of execution, be linked by a close temporal relationship, and relate to the same object of offense.

##### Section 2: Persistent Delict
A Persistent Delict is characterized by the perpetrator's action(s) that bring about and maintain an unlawful state, or by the Perpetrator’s actions that maintain an unlawful state not initiated by the Perpetrator. 

##### Section 3: Collective Delict
A Collective Delict consists of multiple instances of the same Delict committed by the same Perpetrator that are connected by a common intent. 

##### Section 4: Responsibility for Continuing, Persistent and Collective Delicts
1. The perpetrator of a Continuing, Persistent, or Collective Delict shall be subject to punishment based on the most severe Delict or act comprising the said Delict. 
2. A conviction for a Continuing, Persistent, or Collective Delict enables the relevant authority to impose a sanction up to one-half greater than the maximum penalty prescribed for the most severe Delict or act encompassing the Continuing, Persistent, or Collective Delict.

#### Article 9: Special characteristic required of a Perpetrator
1. Where the law stipulates a specific characteristic, qualification, or status as a prerequisite for being deemed a perpetrator of a delict, where the Perpetrator doesn’t possess these traits, the actions will not be deemed that particular Delict.
2. Regarding co-perpetrators:
    a. A co-perpetrator is eligible if they possess the requisite characteristic, qualification, or status.
    b. An individual lacking the specified characteristic, qualification, or status may also be considered a co-perpetrator, provided that at least one individual among the co-perpetrators meets the necessary legal requirements.

### Title 3: Exemptions from Delict liability
#### Article 10: Justifiable emergency
1. An act, which under normal circumstances would constitute a delict and thus be subject to punishment, shall not be punishable if it is committed with the intention of preventing an immediate and direct threat to any legally protected interest.
2. This allows for either the complete exemption from punishment or the reduction thereof, potentially to less than the minimum penalty prescribed by law, based on the specific circumstances of the case.
3. The exemption is contingent upon the absence of any alternative means to avert the threat. It does not apply in any of the following situations:
   
    a. If the threat could have been mitigated through other measures that were reasonably available to the person; and
   
    b. If the harm caused by the act in question is clearly significantly greater than the harm or danger that was sought to be prevented; or
   
    c. If the person facing the danger had a legal or moral obligation to endure it, without taking the action that would constitute a delict.

#### Article 11: Legitimate self-defense
1. An act that would ordinarily constitute a Delict shall not be punishable if it is committed in self-defense to prevent an immediate or ongoing attack against a legally protected interest, such as the life or health of oneself or others.
2. The right to claim self-defense shall not extend to actions that:
   a. Are not necessary for the protection of life or health of the person defending or those being defended; and
   b. Are clearly and significantly excessive in relation to the severity and consequence of the attack.

#### Article 12: Informed consent
1. An act that would otherwise be punishable as a Delict is exempt if committed with the informed consent of the individual whose legally protected interests are affected.
2. Consent must be given voluntarily, explicitly, and clearly, either prior to or during the act before the damage is caused. 
3. Post-act consent is valid only if a reasonable person in the position of the Perpetrator could clearly and without doubt assume that consent would have been granted under the circumstances.

#### Article 13: Acceptable risk
1. An act that would otherwise be punishable as a Delict is exempt from punishment if it is conducted as part of a socially beneficial activity within the scope of one's employment, profession, or role, based on the information available at the time, even if it endangers or violates a legally protected interest, provided no alternative means to achieve the beneficial outcome are available.
2. The exemption does not apply if:
   
   a. The activity endangers human life or health without legal consent,

   b. The intended outcome clearly does not justify the level of risk involved, or
   
   c. The conduct clearly contradicts other legal regulations, public interest, ethical principles, or moral standards.

#### Article 14: Lawful use of weapons
An act is not considered a Delict if weapons are used within the boundaries established by specific provisions to this effect in Laws empowering Law Enforcement Agencies or the Liberland Defense Force to act.

### Title 4: Legal Entity accountability for Delicts
#### Article 15: Criteria for Legal Entity as Perpetrator
##### Section 1: Attributing culpability to a Legal Entity
1. A Legal Entity shall be deemed a perpetrator of a delict if the delict is committed through the actions of an individual, provided that:
   
    a. Such actions are attributable to the Legal Entity;
   
    b. The individual was acting on behalf of the Legal Entity; and
   
    c. The act constitutes a delict under this Law.
   
3. The attribution of actions to the Legal Entity applies in circumstances where the individual is:
   
    a. Acting in representation of the Legal Entity;
   
    b. Engaged in activities directly associated with the operations of the Legal Entity; or
   
    c. Acting for the benefit or advantage of the Legal Entity.
   
5. Imposing liability on a Legal Entity does not automatically exempt the individual perpetrator from responsibility. The individual shall still be held accountable unless it is established that they were not a co-perpetrator or are otherwise not responsible for the delict.

##### Section 2: Degrees of culpability between the Legal Entity and the individual
1. When an individual, whose actions make a Legal Entity liable, commits a delict, that Legal Entity shall bear a proportional degree of liability. This liability ranges from full to Planning, Instigation or Enablement, depending on the Legal Entity's level of involvement in the delict. 
2. The Legal Entity may be considered either fully liable or merely auxiliary to the individual perpetrator.
3. The process of assigning liability to a Legal Entity does not require the identification of the specific individual who committed the act, provided that a genuine effort is made to identify the individual and that effort fails due to circumstances beyond the control of both the entity and the State. Investigative bodies and courts need not determine the identity of this individual to hold the Legal Entity responsible, particularly when it is clear that the delict was carried out as part of the entity's operations.

#### Article 16: Determination of Attributable Actions
1. For the purpose of assessing the liability of a Legal Entity for delicts, actions committed by the following individuals shall be considered attributable to the Legal Entity:

    a. Members of statutory bodies or equivalent organizational structures;
   
    b. Members of any other bodies forming part of the organizational structure of the Legal Entity;
   
    c. Employees or persons in similar positions when performing tasks related to their employment;
   
    d. Individuals executing specific tasks on behalf of the Legal Entity;
   
    e. Individuals engaged by the Legal Entity for participation in its operations;
   
    f. Individuals acting in the interests of the Legal Entity, particularly when the entity derives a benefit from their actions.
   
3. This attribution applies regardless of the formal relationship between the individual and the Legal Entity, focusing instead on the nature of the action and its relevance to the entity's operations or interests.

#### Article 17: Special Characteristics for Legal Entity Perpetrators
If the law stipulates special traits, capabilities, or statuses for a perpetrator who is a Legal Entity, such attributes need not be present in the individual whose actions are attributable to the Legal Entity.

#### Article 18: Special Conditions for Legal Entity liability
1. Liability of the Legal Entity remains intact even if:
   
   a. The individual's actions occurred prior to the Legal Entity's establishment,
   
   b. The Legal Entity was declared invalid by a court,
   
   c. The legal action intended to establish authority is invalid or ineffective,
   
   d. The Legal Entity utilized another entity or individual to commit a Delict, provided these entities are not liable for the Delict.

#### Article 19: Conditions for Legal Entity exemption
1.A Legal Entity is exempt from liability if it demonstrates that all reasonable preventive measures were taken.
2. Exemption is not applicable if the Legal Entity failed to exercise obligatory or necessary oversight over the individual responsible, or if it failed to implement necessary preventive measures.

## Chapter 2: Delicts
### Title 1: Crimes

#### Article 20: Special Law for Crimes
1. Crimes represent the most severe category of delicts and shall be governed, prosecuted, and penalized in accordance with the Criminal Law, a special law to this Law.
2. The Criminal Law shall be the definitive codex for all matters regarding the investigation, punishment, enumeration and adjudication of Crimes.

### Title 2: Misdemeanors
#### Article 21: Defining Misdemeanors
##### Section 1: Classification and Enumeration of Misdemeanors
All delicts not classified as crimes shall be considered Misdemeanors, which will be explicitly enumerated, prosecuted, and penalized under the provisions of this Law. Only acts specifically listed in this Law shall be recognized as Misdemeanors in Liberland.

##### Section 2: Investigation and Adjudication of Misdemeanors
1. The primary investigative authority for Misdemeanors shall be Law Enforcement, with the Court serving as an appellate entity to review decisions made by Law Enforcement.
2. In the initial stages, Law Enforcement will process Misdemeanor cases in accordance with the Administrative Process Law, as detailed further within this Law.
3. In cases advancing to adjudication, Misdemeanors will be subject to the Delict Process, a Special Judiciary Process outlined in this Law, and will be adjudicated before a Court.

#### Article 22: Disciplinary Offenses
##### Section 1: Definition and Jurisdiction
1. Disciplinary Offenses shall be a special category of Misdemeanors. These offenses require that the perpetrator be under the disciplinary authority of the victim. 
2. Unlike standard misdemeanors, the initial handling of a Disciplinary Offense takes place through an Administrative Process led by the victim or their designated authority, rather than through Law Enforcement intervention.

##### Section 2: Adjudication Process
1. If a Disciplinary Offense necessitates formal adjudication beyond the Administrative Process, it will proceed to the judiciary phase consistent with the Delict Process used for Misdemeanors. 
2. The case will be heard by the judiciary, adhering to the same legal standards and court that would apply to any other Misdemeanor.

#### Article 23: Concurrent commission of multiple Delicts
##### Section 1: General Principle
In instances where multiple Delicts are committed through a single act or a set of acts, prosecution shall proceed solely for the Delict subject to the most severe higher range of penalty.

##### Section 2: Crimes and other Delicts
1. Where an act constitutes a Crime and also another Delict, in general, only the Crime shall be prosecuted according to the Criminal Law.
2. In certain specific cases where this Law stipulates otherwise, committing crimes also results in the responsibility for other types of Delict.
### Title 2: Sanctions

#### Article 24: Primary Sanctions
The organ adjudicating a Delict, henceforth “Adjudicating Organ”, may impose one of the following primary sanctions on an individual found guilty:

    a. Admonition, or
    
    b. Loss of Merit.

#### Article 25: Supplementary Sanctions
Alongside the primary sanctions, the following supplementary sanctions may be imposed where legally and materially justified:

    a. Restitution,
    
    b. Asset Forfeiture,
    
    c. Inclusion in a Public Blacklist.
    
    d. Activity Prohibition,
    
    e. Temporary or Permanent Reassignment, or
    
    f. Termination of Employment.

#### Article 26: Admonition
1. In instances where the offense committed is of a minor nature and the offender exhibits signs of remorse or a low likelihood of reoffending, the Adjudicating Organ may opt to issue an Admonition, which may be conveyed either orally or in writing.
2. Prior to issuing an Admonition, the Adjudicating Organ is required to:
   
   a. Clearly explain to the offender the nature of the offense and the possible consequences thereof;
   
   b. Obtain an acknowledgment from the offender of their misconduct; and
   
   c. Secure a commitment from the offender to refrain from repeating the offense. This commitment should be deemed by the Adjudicating Organ as likely to be effective in preventing not only the recurrence of the same offense but also the perpetration of other delicts.

#### Article 27: Loss of Merit
##### Section 1: Imposition of Loss of Merit
1. The principal penalty for committing an Administrative Offense under this Law shall be the Loss of Merit, which entails a deduction from the offender's Liberland Merit (LLM) account balance.
2. The extent of the LLM deduction shall be commensurate with the offense's severity. Offenses that necessitate a deduction of 50,000 LLM or more shall be classified as highly severe.

##### Section 2: Alternative Penalty Payment
1. Offenders have the option to pay a monetary fine to the Government as an alternative to the Loss of Merit. This fine shall be equivalent to the value of the penalty assessed in LLM and may be paid in any currency recognized as valid by Liberland.
2. The fine is payable to the Adjudicating Organ within eight working days from the date of imposition, in an accepted form of currency. Upon full payment of the stipulated amount, the penalty of Loss of Merit shall be considered resolved.

#### Article 28: Restitution and Compensation
##### Section 1: Restitution by the Perpetrator
1. The Adjudicating Organ shall have the authority to order a Perpetrator to make restitution for any form of damage inflicted upon the victim. 
2. This restitution must cover all damages, whether direct or indirect, and must be carried out promptly and at the Perpetrator's expense.

##### Section 2: Compensation in Lieu of Restitution
1. In cases where restitution is deemed impossible or impractical, the Adjudicating Organ shall have the discretion to impose a Compensation order instead. This Compensation shall be calculated based on the actual market value of the damages incurred.
2. The Adjudicating Organ may determine a sanction that combines both Restitution and Compensation, tailored to address the specific circumstances of the harm caused.
3. Where the determination of the costs to compensate seems difficult, this determination might be made a part of the sanction and will provided according to best available practices, with full audit trail and transparency,  and at the cost of the Perpetrator.

##### Section 3: Transition from Restitution to Compensation
1. If, subsequent to the imposition of a Restitution order, it becomes apparent to the Perpetrator that restitution cannot be feasibly executed, the sanction shall then be considered as one of Compensation. 
2. All cases like this will involve the Perpetrator being responsible for the determination of costs for the Compensation.

#### Article 29: Activity Prohibition
1. The Adjudicating Organ may prohibit the offender from engaging in specific activities directly related to the offense if it is evident that the offender lacks the skill or exhibits recklessness in said activities.
2. The sanction of Activity Prohibition is applicable under the following conditions:
   
    a. The offense results in a Loss of Merit penalty exceeding 500 LLM, and the actual Loss of Merit imposed is near or above this threshold; or
   
    b. In instances of repeated offences of the same or similar Delicts performed in conjunction with the given activity, where the cumulative maximum Loss of Merit sanction incurred reaches or is close to 5,000 LLM,
and the overall impact of the offence on public safety or welfare is significant.

4. For first-time offenders of non-criminal Delicts, the prohibition shall not exceed six months, and for repeat offenders, up to 6 months.
5. For all the other offenders, the prohibition shall not exceed 24 months unless the Delict is a Crime.

#### Article 30: Asset Forfeiture
##### Section 1: Grounds for Asset Forfeiture
1. Asset Forfeiture shall be considered when a delict involves the use of any object or animal, and the continued possession of such object or animal by the perpetrator presents a public risk.
2. Asset Forfeiture is applicable under the following conditions:
   
    a. The offense results in a Loss of Merit penalty exceeding 500 Liberland Merit (LLM), with the actual Loss of Merit imposed being near or above this threshold; or
   
    b. In cases of repeated offenses of the same or similar delicts involving the use of the asset in question, where the cumulative maximum Loss of Merit sanction incurred reaches or is close to 1,000 LLM, and the offense significantly impacts public safety or welfare.

##### Section 2: Conditional and Full Forfeitur
1. For less serious delicts or for first-time perpetrators, a "conditional" forfeiture may be issued. 
2. This places the offender on a probationary period of up to 12 months, during which full forfeiture will be enforced for any repeated offense involving the object or animal, regardless of the offense's severity.

##### Section 3: Forfeiture of Animals
Forfeiture may apply to animals in instances of evident mistreatment by the perpetrator, even in cases where the misdemeanor is not directly connected to the animal. This provision is predicated on the assurance that the animal's welfare will be better secured post-forfeiture.

#### Article 31: Processual Forfeiture
1. In instances where a Delict bears a direct relation to any legal process, be it judicial, administrative, or political (such as voting), and results in significant disturbance or delay of said process, accompanied by incurred costs either directly or indirectly attributable to the Delict, the Adjudicating Organ is vested with the authority to compel the perpetrator to reimburse all costs arising directly and indirectly from their delictuous actions, pertaining solely to the affected process.
2. Should the disruption be deemed extreme or recurrent, to the extent that it constitutes a flagrant disregard for the institution of Justice or public order, in particular where the action or some of the actions fulfil the definition of a Crime, the Adjudicating Organ possesses the discretion to:
   
    a. Terminate the perpetrator's participation in the ongoing proceedings; and
   
    b. Forfeit their case outright.
   
#### Article 32: Public Blacklist Inclusion
##### Section 1: Criteria for Inclusion
The Ministry of Justice shall maintain a Public Blacklist where individuals or entities will be listed under the following conditions:

    a. Conviction of a misdemeanor that results in a penalty of 5,000 Liberland Merit (LLM) or more;
    
    b. A negative LLM balance resulting from the accumulation of penalties.

##### Section 2: Duration of Listing
1. The inclusion of an individual or entity on the Public Blacklist shall persist until either of the following conditions is met:

# Book 2: Process Law
Chapter 1: General Provisions
Title 1: Scope of the Delict Process
Procedure for Handling Delicts
Section 1: Overview of the Two-Stage Process
The process for addressing a Delict under this Law shall be bifurcated into two distinct stages, designed to ensure procedural fairness and efficiency.
Section 2: First Stage - Administrative Process
The initial stage of the Delict Process shall be governed by the rules applicable to the Administrative Process. This stage concludes with the issuance of a Misdemeanor Order, marking the preliminary resolution of the matter.
Section 3: Second Stage - Judicial Review
The second stage shall be initiated only if the Misdemeanor Order issued during the first stage is contested.
This subsequent stage shall proceed before the Court, wherein the General Process shall be applied with modifications as prescribed by the special rules of this Law, thereby constituting the Delict Process proper.
Initiation of the Delict Process
The delict proceedings are formally initiated at the First Stage by the Adjudicating Organ. This initiation occurs upon receiving information from a credible source indicating the likely commission of a misdemeanor.
The credible source's information must suggest with reasonable certainty that a misdemeanor has occurred or is about to occur for the Adjudicating Organ to proceed with the initiation of delict proceedings.
Title 2: Principles governing the Delict Process
Presumption of Innocence
Section 1: Principle of Presumption of Innocence
In accordance with this Law, every individual accused of committing a Delict within the jurisdiction of Liberland is to be presumed innocent until their guilt has been conclusively established through due legal process.
The presumption of innocence is a universal principle that shall apply in all stages of legal proceedings and processes conducted within Liberland. Furthermore, this principle is binding upon all private individuals and entities without exception.
Section 2: Burden of Proof
The obligation to substantiate the guilt of the accused lies solely with the State. This encompasses the presentation of sufficient and compelling evidence to overcome the presumption of innocence.
At the commencement of the judicial process, the responsibility for proving guilt rests with the Adjudicating Organ. As the proceedings progress, this responsibility transitions to the Accuser, who must then carry the burden of proof through the remaining stages of the legal process.
Protection from self-incrimination
No individual accused of a crime shall be legally compelled to provide testimony or evidence that would incriminate themselves or members of their immediate family.
Right to face one’s accuser
Section 1: No conviction without information
No individual shall be convicted of a Delict without being duly informed of the charges against them.
Such notification must include sufficient specificity to allow the accused to prepare an adequate defense and must be made sufficiently early on to give effective time and to prevent extreme costs associated with the defense.
Section 2: Right to know the other parties
Every subject accused of a Delict shall have the inherent right to be acquainted with and to confront their accuser. 
This also encompasses the entitlement to know the identities of any Victims involved, but the Adjudicating Organ and presiding Judge retain the discretion to restrict access to the identities of Victims or accusers, although this restriction may only be applied on grounds of compelling necessity and urgency, aimed at protecting the welfare of the Victims or the integrity of the trial process.
Right to hearing and effective remedy
Section 1: Right to a Hearing
Every subject accused of a Delict shall be granted the right to a hearing, during which the adjudicating organ is obligated to genuinely listen and consider the arguments presented by the accused.
Section 2: Right to Effective Remedy
Accused individuals are entitled to raise objections regarding the conduct of law enforcement authorities and the courts.
All such objections shall be considered seriously and in good faith, following the procedures established by applicable law.
Swiftness of Delict Process
Throughout all stages of the Delict Process, an individual accused of a Delict shall be afforded the right to expedited judicial proceedings. 
This right ensures for the accused specifically a faster resolution than the standard timelines prescribed by the principle of Urgency in the General Process.
The accused shall at all times have the power to claim provable instances of undue delays in violation of this special right and also the general principle of Urgency.
Proportion of means
Measures taken against accused subjects in the course of the Delict Process shall not impose an unreasonable burden on them beyond what is necessary for the fulfillment of the process's objectives. 
These objectives include determining the guilt or innocence of the accused and ensuring the protection and safety of the victim, along with facilitating restitution where applicable.
Transparency
All the proceedings for a Delict in whichever phase shall be conducted orderly and with regularity and also in such a way that no reasonable doubt can be cast on this by other parties.
Any individual accused of a Delict shall possess the right to request that their proceedings be conducted publicly. This right is exercisable notwithstanding any prior judicial determinations to restrict the publicity of proceedings.
The invocation of this right by the accused must be predicated upon well-founded and thoroughly documented justification. Justifiable grounds for such a request include, but are not limited to, a substantiated concern regarding the potential lack of objectivity on the part of the court.
Upon presentation of such justifications by the accused, it shall be incumbent upon the Adjudicating Organ or the presiding Judge to grant the request for a public trial, provided the reasons are deemed consistent, free of contradictions and material absurdities and seem to be presented in good faith. 
Dignity of the accused
Section 1: Participation and Treatment of the Accused
Notwithstanding the accusatory nature of the proceedings, every individual accused of a Delict shall maintain the right to actively participate in their defense throughout the Delict Process. No aspect of the proceedings shall render the accused as a mere object subject to negotiation of their fate.
At no stage of the Delict Process shall the accused be subjected to torture or to any form of inhuman or degrading treatment. This provision upholds the fundamental rights of the accused, ensuring dignity and respect irrespective of the charges faced.
Section 2: Prohibition of Exemplary Punishments
The imposition of exemplary punishments in Liberland is strictly prohibited. No punishment shall be made more severe than warranted by the specific circumstances of the case, nor shall it be intensified to serve as a deterrent or to instill fear of the law in the general populace.
Punishments shall be determined solely on the basis of the seriousness of the individual case, ensuring that justice is administered fairly and without prejudice to the principle of proportionality.
Chapter 2: First Stage of the Delict Process
Title 1: First Stage Process Order
Scope of the First Stage
The first stage of delict proceedings shall encompass the following key actions:
Conducting a thorough investigation into the facts of the case, both factual and legal.
Applying the relevant laws to these facts to determine whether the actions or omissions of the perpetrator may constitute a delict.
Establishing a high likelihood that a delict has occurred, ensuring that the chances of a successful outcome—either through the perpetrator's acceptance of a Misdemeanor Order or through victory in the Second Stage—are reasonable in relation to the anticipated costs.
In cases of uncertainty regarding the advisability of proceeding, the following steps will be taken:
Consultation with the Ministry of Finance to ascertain whether pursuing the prosecution is economically viable.
Notification to the perpetrator, providing them with sufficient details about the alleged misdemeanor to enable a response.
The procedure following the communication to the perpetrator shall be as follows:
Awaiting the perpetrator's response within a prescribed timeframe.
If the response is silence, proceeding to await payment of the fine or, failing that, enforcing the Loss of Merit sanction.
If the response is an objection, forwarding the Case File to the appropriate court for formal delict proceedings and notifying the perpetrator of this action.
Decision in the First Stage
Section 1: Insufficient grounds for prosecution
During the initial phase of investigation into a Delict, should the Administrative Organ find the evidence against the accused to be insufficient to substantiate a charge, it is empowered to:
Terminate the investigation when it is evident that the criteria necessary for proceeding with prosecution are not fulfilled.
Cease further prosecution actions if definitive evidence establishes the innocence of the accused, thereby precluding any subsequent prosecutorial actions for the same incident involving the same individual. Following such determination, the case shall be formally closed, barring any organ from initiating prosecution against the accused for the related activities.
Section 2: Delict Order
In instances where the decision is made to continue with the prosecution, the Administrative Organ shall issue an Order that encompasses:
The identification of the Perpetrator,
A precise identification of the Delict, including specific references to applicable sections or articles of the Law for clarity.
A compilation of the names of the accused individual(s), noting any co-accused parties.
A detailed account of the nature of the perpetration, elucidating all pertinent factors that influence the accused's liability, including but not limited to, actions or inactions, and the characterization of the act as continuous, recurrent, or executed by multiple parties.
A delineation of the actions deemed to constitute the Delict.
An explanation underpinning the assignment of responsibility for the Delict to the accused, tailored to the unique aspects of the case.
A reference to the evidence considered at each decisive juncture, detailing the foundations for both the decision made and its subsequent justification.
The sanction type and the exact enumerated value of this sanction.
The administrative costs for the process which the Perpetrator needs to cover that Liberland incurred due to the prosecution, including the setup of the costs and the evidence for how they were incurred, notably invoices and payment receipts, with the reasoning as to why the given costs were necessary.
The Delict Order shall include information that it can be Objected within 8 workdays after reception; where it is objected, the order is thereby annulled and the case moves to the Second Stage. 
Where it is not objected for the 8 workdays, the Delict Order gains legal force and becomes binding upon the Perpetrator.
Section 3: Simplified Payment Order
A Simplified Payment Order may be issued by the Adjudicating Organ in cases where:
The delict committed has minimal impact, warranting sanctions such as Admonition or Loss of Merit not exceeding 500 LLM; or
There is an agreement between the Adjudicating Organ and the perpetrator on the facts of the case, and the perpetrator acknowledges guilt, accepts the sanctions, and agrees to the calculation of process costs.
The content of the Simplified Payment Order shall include only:
Identification of the perpetrator;
Simple description of the facts of the case and why the Perpetrator’s actions constitute a Delict;
Specification of the Delict, including the relevant article, section, and alinea of this Law upon which the Delict and the sanction is based;
Type and amount of the sanction, where applicable;
Administrative costs stated as a total amount, without itemization.
When a Simplified Payment Order is issued with the full consent of the perpetrator, it precludes the right to issue an objection against the Order. The Payment Order gains legal force on the spot and the time to pay up the Loss of Merit sanction, where that is given, and the administrative costs, shall be set to 15 working days.
In cases where the Simplified Payment Order is not fully agreed upon by the perpetrator, the provisions for issuing an objection shall be identical to those applicable to a Delict Order.
Criteria for Adjudicating Delicts
Section 1: Evidence Collection and Verification
All decisions in Delict cases shall be based on evidence that is concrete and factually grounded. Acceptable forms of evidence include, but are not limited to, photographs, physical objects, written statements, and official documents.
Direct observations by Administrative Organs or witnesses, as well as confessions from suspects, are deemed valid forms of evidence. However, these must be:
Documented in a manner that allows for independent third-party verification.
Recorded either during the event or immediately following the event or receipt of an oral witness statement.
Section 2: Decision-Making Process
Decisions regarding Delicts must be:
Based on a thorough and reasoned analysis of the case facts.
Supported by explicit references to the evidence gathered.
Section 3: Documentation and Archiving
Proper documentation of all evidence is mandatory. This includes the method of evidence collection, the time and date of its acquisition, and any relevant observations or statements related to the evidence.
All documented evidence and related decision-making records must be forwarded to the Ministry of Justice. These documents will be archived for future reference, ensuring the integrity of the adjudication process and facilitating any necessary reviews or appeals.
Title 2: Administrative considerations
Recovery of Process Costs in Delict Cases
Section 1: Compensation Obligation
Individuals found guilty in Delict cases shall be required to compensate the Government for administrative costs incurred. These costs include, but are not limited to, expenses directly related to the investigation of the case and the issuance of the Misdemeanor Order.
For costs to be compensable, they must:
Have been actually incurred by the Government;
Be demonstrably necessary for the conduct of the investigation and the preparation of the Delict Order;
Be provably accurate, reflecting the minimal necessary actions undertaken during these processes.
Should the obligated compensation not be paid within eight days, it will be converted into a deduction from the individual's Liberland Merits (LLM), calculated at the market price of LLM in Liberland Dollars at the time of conversion. Subsequent payment of the compensation in a currency accepted by the Government will result in the unconditional restoration of the deducted merits.
Section 2: Calculation of Compensation Amount
The compensation amount demanded from the perpetrator will not cover the total expenses borne by the Government in the misdemeanor proceedings. Instead, it will reflect an amount deemed necessary to cover administrative tasks under ideal conditions.
The maximal amount of compensation shall be ⅓ of the sanction of Loss of Merit incurred with the maximum being 500 LLM regardless of the actually incurred costs; and 20 LLM in case of an Admonition.
The Ministry of Justice shall establish a uniform tariff through regulation, which will be used as the basis for calculating claims for administrative costs against perpetrators in Delict cases. This tariff aims to ensure fairness and consistency in the assessment of compensable costs.
Administrative Organ for Delicts
The primary Administrative Organ responsible for on-the-ground investigation of Delicts in Liberland shall be the Watch.
In areas proximate to a Border Crossing Point, the responsible administrative organ shall be IBIS.
Delicts that take place outside of Liberland shall be placed under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Justice.
Chapter 3: Second Stage: Delict Judicial Process
Title 1: General Considerations
Special Process
The judicial procedure for handling delicts, referred to herein as the "Delict Process," is hereby designated as a Special Process within the meaning of the Judicial Process Law.
The Delict Process shall adhere to the General Process outlined in the Judicial Process Law, applying its principles and procedures to the adjudication of delicts.
Parties in Delict Process
Section 1: Parties in Delict Process
In any proceeding concerning a delict, the recognized parties shall be as follows:
The Adjudicating Organ, assuming the role of the Accuser, taking up the rights and responsibilities of the Applicant;
The Defendant, being the individual or entities identified as the Perpetrator(s) or co-Perpetrators of the delict, taking up the rights and responsibilities of the Respondent;
The Victim(s), who have suffered harm as a result of the Delict.
Section 2: Participation of Additional Persons and Entities
While additional persons and entities may be involved in the delict proceedings, they shall not be considered parties to the case.
Such participants are precluded from exercising decision-making authority on certain matters within the proceedings, as stipulated by the Judicial Process Law.
Legal Representation
Section 1: Right to Representation
The right to legal representation is universally guaranteed. Specifically, the Accused shall enjoy an enhanced right to be represented, reflecting the importance of effective legal counsel in ensuring a fair trial.
The Accused shall be explicitly informed of their right to legal counsel. They shall be afforded ample opportunity to select legal counsel that best meets their needs and preferences.
Section 2: Appointment of Counsel
Should the Accused opt to delegate the selection of legal counsel to the Court, a legal counsel shall be appointed to them by the Court.
Section 3: Financial Arrangements for Legal Representation
Agreements or other arrangements notwithstanding, the obligation of the Defendant to remunerate legal counsel shall not arise prior to the issuance of the Verdict that has acquired legal force and the determination of court costs.
Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding paragraph, legal representation shall be considered a component of regular court costs and, as such, shall be the responsibility of the party adJudged to bear the court costs.
Limits of Substitution
Section 1: Effect of Death on Delict Proceedings
The liability for a delict is extinguished upon the death of the party who is a natural person. As such, no substitution due to death is permissible for the Defendant. 
Consequently, the legal process concerning the deceased Defendant shall be deemed as if it had not progressed to the second stage, effectively terminating the proceedings.
Section 2: Non-substitutability in Non-criminal Delicts
In cases of delicts that do not constitute crimes, substitution of the accuser is not permitted. Should the accuser's entity cease to exist, undergo division that destroys the identity or changes the fundamental rules, persons and systems of the accuser, or undergo any change negating its original status, all related delict proceedings shall be concluded automatically within three months following such change.
Section 3: Extraordinary Powers of the Ministry of Justice
The Ministry of Justice is vested with extraordinary authority to assume jurisdiction over certain cases regarding non-criminal Delicts if the cessation or alteration of the accuser's entity occurs. 
This power includes the ability to reassign such cases to other agencies, provided that
the reassignment is essential for the protection of individual liberty, life, health, and property, or 
the likelihood of a state victory in the proceedings is very high.
Withdrawal
Section 1: Consequences of Withdrawal by the Accused
In the event that the Defendant opts to withdraw from the proceedings, such withdrawal shall constitute an automatic full confession of guilt to the Delict precisely as that is presented by the Accuser at the time of withdrawal.
Following the Defendant's withdrawal, the proceedings shall continue without their participation as a Party. However, the Accused may still be summoned as a Witness or another source of information. 
The verdict will be rendered considering the Defendant's admission of guilt. Although rare, this may result in a partially innocent verdict, but it predominantly leads to a finding of guilt.
Section 2: Consequences of Withdrawal by the Accuser
Withdrawal by the Accuser results in the automatic dismissal of the accusations against the Defendant. A verdict shall then be issued as though the Accuser had declared the Defendant to be fully and unequivocally innocent.
Despite the Accuser's withdrawal, there remains a possibility, albeit rare, that the proceedings may retain a finding of some degree of guilt for the Defendant. However, in most instances, the verdict will be one of innocence.
Third-Party Intervention
Third-party intervention in the process of adjudicating a Delict shall be permitted exclusively under the condition that the intervening party is a victim newly identifying themselves in relation to the Delict.
To qualify for intervention, the newly identifying victim must demonstrate, with a reasonable degree of certainty, that they would be recognized as a victim of the act in question, should the accusation succeed either in whole or in part.
Judge
In the adjudication of non-Criminal Delicts, the matter shall be presided over by a single Judge. 
The constitution of Judicial Panels for such cases is hereby excluded.
Elevated  standard of Decision-making
Beyond the stipulations of the Judicial Process Law regarding judicial decision-making, decisions concerning guilt, sentencing, and the imposition of sanctions must adhere to an enhanced standard of proof. Specifically, facts must be established beyond a reasonable doubt.
This elevated standard requires the Accuser to present strong and persuasive evidence, which is sufficient to negate any reasonable alternative explanations for the facts in question.
The responsibility to meet this elevated standard of proof lies solely with the Accuser, in order to safeguard the principle of the presumption of innocence. Accordingly, the Defendant is only required to meet the standard of proof as delineated in the General Process provisions.
Requalification
Section 1: Criteria for Requalification
In instances where the presiding Judge determines, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the Delict in question would constitute a Crime if perpetrated, the judicial process concerning the Delict shall be halted.
Subsequently, the case shall be transferred to the Criminal Court for appropriate adjudication.
Section 2: Internal Transfer Procedures
If the Criminal Court functions within the same judicial structure as the Judge making the determination, the transfer of the case shall occur internally within said court.
The Judge may only transfer the case to themselves for further criminal proceedings in exceptional circumstances where no alternative procedural avenue exists.
In such instances, the criminal process shall commence anew, ensuring due process and the integrity of the judicial procedure.

Verdict
Section 1: Composition of Verdicts
Every verdict issued by the court must, besides fulfilling all the requirements of the Verdict in General Process, clearly state whether the accused is found innocent or guilty of the charges filed against them.
In cases resulting in a guilty verdict, the court is required to impose at least one Primary Sanction on the Defendant, along with any Secondary Sanctions deemed appropriate.
Section 2: Restitution of the Victim
All guilty verdicts must include a provision for the restitution of the Victim. 
The restitution shall be commensurate with the damage the Victim has provably sustained due to the actions of the Perpetrator. 
This encompasses damages resulting directly from the Delict and, where justice necessitates, damages resulting indirectly.
Section 3: Determinations Within Guilty Verdicts
The final judgment on a guilty verdict can substantially differ from the initial accusations made by the accuser. The Judge has the discretion to:
Assign a lesser or partial level of guilt to the Defendant;
Reclassify the charged delict to a less serious category; or
Levy a penalty less severe than initially demanded.
Section 4: Constraints on Judicial Discretion
Although Judges have the authority to sentence harsher penalties than those proposed by the Accuser, such sentences must not exceed the statutory maximum for the most severe Delict charged.
The Judge's ability to modify sentencing is limited by the principle that no imposed penalty can exceed the maximum allowable for the most serious delict charged.
Should a Judge reclassify the actions of the Defendant to a delict carrying a minimal penalty higher than the maximum for the originally charged delict, the Judge must impose the maximum penalty associated with the delict for which the Defendant was initially accused.
The above notwithstanding, the restitution of the Victim shall always follow the legal truth and therefore shall be based on the Delict for which the Defendant is being charged.
Title 2: Steps of the Delict Process
Controversial Process
All proceedings related to a Delict shall be inherently controversial. As a result, any provisions or regulations pertaining to Non-Controversial Processes shall not be applicable to Delict proceedings.
Exclusion of Written Process
As a general rule, the Written Process shall not be conducted in judicial proceedings.
The Written Process may only be initiated if the presiding Judge determines that the case is either sufficiently simple or the Administrative Delict Process examined it with a sufficient thoroughness to warrant such a process as adequate for resolution.
In instances where the Written Process is used but later deemed insufficient for case resolution, the determination of Court Costs associated with it shall adhere to the guidelines established for the Administrative Delict Process.
Delict Process Application
Section 1: Application requirements
The Application initiating the Delict Process shall be predicated upon the previously rejected Delict Order. 
Where a simplified Payment Order is issued instead of a Delict Order, the Application shall be set up ad hoc based on the criteria established for full Delict Orders.
The Application shall include the full file of the First Stage of the Delict Process including all the items of evidence and all the basis of reasoning, along with explanations where those are needed to make the entire set of information easy to understand by the Judge and the other Parties.
While the Administrative Organ may make modifications to the Application vis a vis a pre-existing Delict Order or Payment Order, such amendments must not substantially alter the subject matter outlined in the original order.
Section 2: Delivery and Summons
Ordinarily, the Court is responsible for delivering the Application to all relevant parties, accompanied by a summons to appear at trial.
Section 3: Exception for Written Process
In instances where the Judge, by exception, opts for a Written Process, the further process regarding the Application shall continue in accordance with the General Process rules without any alterations.
No Mediation
The procedure for addressing a Delict shall proceed without the inclusion of Mediation. 
In instances of uncertainty regarding the application of Mediation, it shall be presumed that an attempt at Mediation was undertaken and concluded unsuccessfully, albeit with no attributed failure to any involved party.
Right to Modify the Application
Section 1: Modification Rights of the Accuser
The Accuser is granted the right to modify the Application before the Trial begins. This includes alterations to the claims or the factual and legal basis of the Application.
The above notwithstanding, the Accuser may withdraw any part of or the entire claim at any stage of the Trial proceedings, or otherwise modify their Application in agreement and to the benefit of the Defendant, up until the Verdict becomes legally binding.
Section 2: Rights of the Victim to Modify Claims
The Victim retains the right to modify their claim throughout the Trial proceedings. This encompasses the ability to change any details of the claim or to completely withdraw the Application.
Should the Victim choose to withdraw their Application, they may risk losing their right to seek restitution. The determination of such forfeiture will depend on the particular circumstances of the withdrawal, considering factors such as the timing and reasons for the decision.
Plea Bargain
Section 1: Initiation of Plea Bargains
The Accuser is entitled to propose a Plea Bargain to the Defendant, permitting the Defendant to acknowledge guilt fully or partially concerning the charges or specific aspects thereof in exchange for the modification of the Application to the benefit of the Defendant.
The process of negotiating and finalizing a Plea Bargain must be comprehensively recorded. It is the sole responsibility of the Accuser to ensure that such documentation is complete and accurate.
Where this responsibility is not sustained, the Judge shall order the negotiations to be redone and shall ensure their documentation at the expense of the Accuser.
Section 2: Victim Involvement and Rights
Plea Bargain agreements must be communicated to any Victims associated with the case. Victims reserve the right to submit recommendations or express outright disagreement with the proposed Plea Bargain.
In cases of disagreement or recommendations by Victims, the Accuser and Defendant are required to address and satisfy the concerns raised by the Victims to proceed with the Plea Bargain.
Section 3: Administrative Costs and Responsibilities
All administrative expenses related to the Plea Bargain process shall initially be covered by the Accuser.
Should a Judge determine that a Victim's delay or objection is made in bad faith or is vexatious, a warning will be issued to the Victim. If the Victim persists, they may be held responsible for any subsequent Plea Bargain costs incurred due to their actions.
Section 4: Court Costs Agreement
The Plea Bargain agreement must include provisions for the allocation of court costs. 
In the absence of such an agreement, or if the agreement does not fully cover the costs, the Judge will decree that the costs be divided between the Accuser and the Defendant.
Procedure for Appeals Against Decisions on Delicts
Section 1: Grounds for Appeal
Appeals against decisions rendered in cases of delicts must be made on at least one of the following grounds:
Determinations of guilt or innocence, including the assessment of degrees of guilt, partial guilt, or specific aspects of the case, while acknowledging others.
Judgments concerning the penalty, where the principle of guilt is not contested, but the appeal concerns the extent of guilt, particular elements of the case, or exclusively the nature or severity of the sanction imposed.
Rulings on the costs associated with the case, particularly where such costs are argued to be disproportionately high or based on inaccurately presented facts.
Section 2: Limitations on the Court of Appeals
The Court of Appeals shall use the General Process rules for conducting the Appeals Process regarding a Delict. 
However, the Court of Appeals is in general precluded from increasing the severity of the penalty beyond that determined by the first instance court.
Should the delict be adjudged more severe by the Court of Appeals, the penalty shall remain as imposed by the first instance court.
In cases where the delict is recognized as warranting a minimum punishment that exceeds the maximum punishment for the delict as judged in the first instance, the maximum punishment for the reclassified delict shall apply, even if it exceeds the punishment originally imposed.
Section 3: Referral to Criminal Court
When the Court of Appeals reclassifies a delict as a crime, the case shall be forwarded to the Criminal Court for further adjudication.
Should the Criminal Court conclude that the act in question does not meet the criteria for a crime, the following provisions shall apply
The proceedings related to the criminal aspect of the case shall be deemed concluded, and the individual's guilty status for the Delict, as determined by the verdict of the first instance, shall remain unaffected.
However, 
Any previously imposed sanctions for the delict except for Restitution shall be annulled.
The Delict shall not count for the purpose of determining repeated perpetration in case of future Delict proceedings;
Despite the annulment of the sanctions:
The Perpetrator will be obligated to cover all process costs incurred throughout the Delict proceedings, except for those for the Criminal process, which shall be covered by the Accuser.
The sanction of Restitution shall remain in effect and enforceable against the perpetrator exactly as ordered by the Court in the first instance.
Supreme Court
The Supreme Court shall, in general, prioritise before other Cases the hearing of Delict Cases that have significant consequences for the Perpetrator, especially in instances where:
There exists substantial doubt regarding the fairness of the verdict or the integrity of the preceding process; especially when
The case pertains to an alleged Crime.
