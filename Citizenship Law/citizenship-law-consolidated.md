# Interim Citizenship Law
## Preamble

WHEREAS, Citizenship in Liberland is a foundational institution that forms the core of its legislative branch;

WHEREAS, the unique role of Citizenship in Liberland as a potent legislative entity must align with the global understanding of Citizenship as a form of membership and protection;

WHEREAS, the creation of an egalitarian society, where Citizens are recognized as individual entities rather than mere components of a collective, is imperative;

WHEREAS, it is essential to empower Citizens to actively participate in collective decision-making, thereby influencing their political standing in a tangible manner;

WHEREAS, the recognition of multiple pathways to Citizenship—such as proof of commitment, sponsorship, and descent—is vital for the inclusivity and diversity of the Citizenry;

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ENACTED by the Citizens and the Government of Liberland.

### Title 1: Citizenship

4. Failure to provide the requested data shall result in the rejection of the Applicant's application.

##### Section 2: Exceptional Circumstances
1. In cases involving particularly egregious conduct, where:

   a) Historically, the actions of the Citizen would have without any reasonable doubt merited the death penalty before a just court; or

   b) Contemporary rule-of-law abiding nations of good standing regularly revoke the citizenship of their nationals for similar conduct;

the Citizenship Commission may escalate the case to the Cabinet for review.
