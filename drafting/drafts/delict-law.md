# Delict Law

## Chapter 1: General provisions

### Title 1: Committing Delicts

#### Article 1: Definition of Delict

1. A delict is defined as either:

   a) An action that breaches the Non-Aggression Principle, leading to identifiable harm to another person or, in exceptional cases,

   b) An action that significantly violates established laws, irrespective of whether the victim is easily identifiable,

   provided that either the harm or the predominant aspect of the act occurs within the jurisdiction of Liberland or involves an individual or entity subject to Liberland's jurisdiction.
   
2. Any individual, whether they are permanently or temporarily under the jurisdiction of Liberland, is responsible for the delicts they commit. If found guilty, they are obligated to make restitution to the victims and will be subject to penalties as outlined in this law to deter future delictual behavior.

#### Article 2: Perpetration of a Delict

1. An individual is considered a Perpetrator if, through their culpable conduct, they fulfil the elements of a Delict or its attempt.

2. A perpetrator also includes an individual who utilizes another individual, who is not liable for the Delict due to lack of age or incapacity, or because their conduct satisfies the conditions of self-defense, extreme necessity, or other circumstances negating unlawfulness.

3. A perpetrator also includes an individual who utilizes a legal entity that is not liable for the Delict.

4. Where the law so stipulates, a perpetrator also includes an individual who intentionally:

   a) Planned or directed the commission of the Delict (Organizer),

   b) Instigated another to decide to commit the Delict (Inciter), or

   c) Enabled or facilitated another in committing the Delict (Accomplice),

   provided that the Delict is completed or its attempt is punishable.

#### Article 3: Liability of the Perpetrator
1. Liability for a Delict requires culpability. 
2. Negligence suffices as culpability unless the law explicitly states that intentional culpability is required.

#### Article 4: Intentional culpability
An offense is committed intentionally if the perpetrator:

   a) Intended to violate or endanger an interest protected by law, or

   b) Knew that their actions could violate or endanger an interest protected by law, and was willing to accept that risk.

#### Article 5: Negligence
An offense is committed negligently if the perpetrator:

   a) Knew that their actions could violate or endanger an interest protected by law, but without reasonable grounds relied on not violating or endangering that interest, or

   b) Did not know that their actions could violate or endanger an interest protected by law, but should and could have known given the circumstances and their personal situation.

### Title 2: Principles of Liability for Delicts

#### Article 6: Attempted Delict
An attempted Delict shall be punishable in the same manner as a finished Delict, though the punishment might be less severe based on the circumstance.

#### Article 7: Continued Delict
A continuing Delict is understood to mean such conduct wherein individual constituent acts, guided by a unified intent, fulfil the elements of the same offence and are connected by the same or similar means of execution, close temporal proximity, and subject matter relatedness.

#### Article 8: Mass Offense
A mass offence is an offence for which the law requires multiple acts connected by a common intent for liability to arise for the offence.

#### Article 9: Omission
For the purposes of this law, "conduct" also includes the omission of such action to which the actor was obligated pursuant to another legal regulation or official decision, resulting from a voluntarily assumed duty to law or if his special obligation arose from his previous endangering conduct, or for which he was obligated for another reason based on the circumstances and his conditions.

#### Article 10: Co-offender
1. If a Delict or its attempt was committed by the intentional joint conduct of two or more individuals, each is liable as if they had committed the Delict alone.

2. If the Delict was committed by joint conduct of two or more entities, of which at least one is a legal person or a self-employed individual, each is liable as if they had committed the Delict alone.

#### Article 11: Special subject of a Delict
If the law requires a special characteristic, qualification, or status of the perpetrator for the commission of a Delict, the following may apply:

  a) The perpetrator can only be one who possesses the required characteristic, qualification, or status.

  b) A co-perpetrator can be one who possesses the required characteristic, qualification, or status, and also one who does not possess the required characteristic, qualification, or status, provided that at least one of the co-perpetrators possesses the required characteristic, qualification, or status.

### Title 3: Legal Entity accountability for Delicts

#### Article 12: Criteria for Legal Entity as Perpetrator

1. A Legal Entity is deemed the perpetrator when a delict is committed through the actions of an individual, whose conduct is attributable to the Legal Entity and who has breached a legal obligation incumbent upon the Legal Entity.

2. This applies when the individual is acting:

   a) In representation of the Legal Entity,
   
   b) In direct association with its operations, or
   
   c) For its benefit or advantage.

3. If an individual acting in such a capacity is culpable of a delict, the Legal Entity shall assume liability for the delict.

4. Full liability of the Legal Entity absolves the individual perpetrator, except when they are determined to be co-perpetrators or jointly accountable for the delict.

5. The Legal Entity's liability is not contingent upon identifying the specific individual responsible. The investigative body or court is also not obligated to identify this individual, particularly when it is evident that the actions were part of the Legal Entity's operations.

#### Article 13: Typical Agents for Legal Entity liability

For assessing a Legal Entity's liability, actions from the following individuals are considered attributable to the Legal Entity:

   a) Statutory bodies or their members,
   
   b) Other organizational bodies or their members,
   
   c) Employees or similar positions while performing job-related tasks,
   
   d) Individuals executing tasks for the Legal Entity,
   
   e) Individuals engaged by the Legal Entity in its operations,
   
   f) Individuals acting in the Legal Entity's interest, if the entity benefits from the outcome.

#### Article 14: Special Characteristics for Legal Entity Perpetrators

If the law stipulates special traits, capabilities, or statuses for a perpetrator who is a Legal Entity, such attributes need not be present in the individual whose actions are attributable to the Legal Entity.

#### Article 15: Special Conditions for Legal Entity liability

Liability of the Legal Entity remains intact even if:

   a) The individual's actions occurred prior to the Legal Entity's establishment,
   
   b) The Legal Entity was declared invalid by a court,
   
   c) The legal action intended to establish authority is invalid or ineffective,
   
   d) The Legal Entity utilized another entity or individual to commit a Delict, provided these entities are not liable for the Delict.

#### Article 16: Conditions for Legal Entity exemption

1. A Legal Entity is exempt from liability if it demonstrates that all reasonable preventive measures were taken.

2. Exemption is not applicable if the Legal Entity failed to exercise obligatory or necessary oversight over the individual responsible, or if it failed to implement necessary preventive measures.

### Title 4: Exemptions from Delict liability

#### Article 17: Justifiable emergency

1. An act that would otherwise be punishable as a Delict is exempt if committed to prevent an immediate and direct threat to a legally protected interest.

2. The exemption does not apply if the threat could have been mitigated by other means, if the harm caused by the act is equal to or greater than the impending danger, or if the person facing the danger was obligated to endure it.

#### Article 18: Legitimate self-defense

1. An act that would otherwise be punishable as a Delict is exempt if committed to ward off an immediate or ongoing attack on a legally protected interest.

2. The exemption does not apply if the defensive action is clearly disproportionate to the nature of the attack.

#### Article 19: Informed consent

1. An act that would otherwise be punishable as a Delict is exempt if committed with the informed consent of the individual whose legally protected interests are affected.

2. Consent must be given voluntarily, explicitly, and clearly, either prior to or during the act. Post-act consent is valid only if the actor could reasonably assume that consent would have been granted under the circumstances.

#### Article 20: Acceptable risk

1. An act that would otherwise be punishable as a Delict is exempt if it is conducted as part of a socially beneficial activity within the scope of one's employment, profession, or role, based on the information available at the time, even if it endangers or violates a legally protected interest, provided no alternative means to achieve the beneficial outcome are available.

2. The exemption does not apply if:

   a) The activity endangers human life or health without legal consent,
   
   b) The intended outcome clearly does not justify the level of risk involved, or
   
   c) The conduct clearly contradicts other legal regulations, public interest, ethical principles, or moral standards.

#### Article 21: Lawful use of weapons

An act is not considered a Delict if weapons are used within the boundaries established by Police Law.

## Chapter 2: Delict Typology

#### Article 22: Delict categories

##### Section 1: Crimes
1. Crimes represent the most severe category of delicts and shall be governed, prosecuted, and penalized in accordance with the Criminal Law.
2. The judicial body responsible for the investigation and adjudication of crimes shall be the Court, assisted by Law Enforcement agencies, and shall operate in accordance with the Criminal Process set of judicial process rules.

##### Section 2: Administrative Offenses
1. All other delicts, not classified as crimes, shall be enumerated, prosecuted, and penalized under the provisions of this Law. The types of delicts other than Crimes shall be

   a) Misdemeanors, and

   b) Disciplinary Offenses,

   which shall together be known as Administrative Delicts.

2. The primary investigative authority for Administrative Delicts shall be Law Enforcement, with the Court serving as an appellate body for reviewing Law Enforcement decisions.

3. Delicts falling under the jurisdiction of Law Enforcement shall be processed in accordance with the Administrative Process Law as further specified in this Law. In instances where such delicts are subject to Court review, the Court shall follow the rules for the Disciplinary Process.

#### Article 23: Definition and Scope of Misdemeanors
1. A Misdemeanor is defined as any delict specifically categorized as such under the provisions of this Law.
2. In cases where it is unequivocally established that an act constitutes a delict, but there is ambiguity regarding its specific classification, the act shall default to being treated as a Misdemeanor.

#### Article 24: Definition and Scope of Disciplinary Offenses
1. The State shall exercise disciplinary jurisdiction over all government agents or volunteers engaged in public projects who are either physically present within its territorial boundaries or are involved in tasks that are integral to and directly associated with the settlement.
Such individuals shall be referred to as persons "on active duty" for the purposes of this Law.
2. A Disciplinary Offense is defined as a delict committed by a person "on active duty," as outlined in this Law.

#### Article 25: Concurrent commission of multiple Delicts

##### Section 1: General Principle
In instances where multiple Delicts are committed through a single act, prosecution shall proceed solely for the Delict subject to the most severe penalty.

##### Section 2: Crimes and other Delicts
1. Where an act constitutes a Crime and also another Delict, in general, only the Crime shall be prosecuted according to the Criminal Law. 
2. In certain specific cases where this Law stipulates otherwise, committing crimes also results in the responsibility for other types of Delict.

### Title 2: Sanctions for Administrative Offenses

#### Article 26: Primary Administrative Sanctions

The Administrative Organ may impose one of the following primary sanctions on an individual found guilty of an Administrative Offense:

   a) Admonition, or
   
   b) Loss of Merit.
   
#### Article 27: Supplementary Administrative Sanctions

Alongside the primary sanctions, the following supplementary sanctions may be imposed where legally justified:

   a) Activity Prohibition,
   
   b) Asset Forfeiture, or
   
   c) Inclusion in a Public Blacklist.

#### Article 28: Admonition

1. In cases where the offense is minor and the offender shows remorse or is unlikely to reoffend, the Administrative Organ may issue an oral or written Admonition.
   
2. The Administrative Organ must inform the offender of the nature of the offense and its potential consequences. The offender must acknowledge their wrongdoing and commit to not repeating the offense.

#### Article 29: Loss of Merit

##### Section 1: General Provisions
1. The standard penalty for an Administrative Offense shall be Loss of Merit, resulting in a reduction of the offender's LLM account balance.
   
2. The range of the LLM deduction shall reflect the severity of the offense, with offenses warranting a maximum deduction of 50,000 LLM or more considered highly severe.

##### Section 2: Option for Fine Payment
3. At the offender's request, a monetary fine may be paid to the Government through the Administrative Organ in lieu of Loss of Merit.
   
4. The fine must be paid within five working days in an accepted currency. Full payment of the fine will negate the Loss of Merit.

#### Article 30: Activity Prohibition

1. The Administrative Organ may prohibit the offender from engaging in specific activities directly related to the offense if it is evident that the offender lacks the skill or exhibits recklessness in said activities.
   
2. For first-time offenders of non-criminal Administrative Offenses, the prohibition shall not exceed six months, and for repeat offenders, up to 12 months.
   
3. The Administrative Organ shall set achievable conditions for the offender to demonstrate improved competence or responsible behavior.

#### Article 31: Asset Forfeiture

1. If an Administrative Offense involves the use of an object or animal and continued possession poses a public risk, the Administrative Organ may seize the object or animal.
   
2. This sanction is applicable only for offenses with a maximum Loss of Merit exceeding 5,000 LLM, where the actual Loss of Merit is near or above this amount, and the overall impact of the offense is significant.
   
3. A "conditional" forfeiture may be issued, placing the offender on a probationary period of up to 12 months. Full forfeiture will be enforced for repeated offenses involving the object or animal, regardless of the offense's severity.
   
4. Forfeiture may also apply to animals in cases of evident mistreatment by the owner, provided that the animal's welfare will be better ensured post-forfeiture.

#### Article 32: Public Blacklist Inclusion

1. An individual or entity shall be included in the Public Blacklist, maintained by the Ministry of Justice, under the following conditions:

a) Conviction of a misdemeanor resulting in a penalty of 5,000 LLM or more, or

b) A negative LLM balance resulting from the accumulation of previous penalties.

2. The inclusion in the Public Blacklist shall remain indefinitely, or until the LLM balance of the listed individual or entity is restored to a minimum of one LLM.

### Title 3: Sanctions for Disciplinary Offenses

#### Article 33: Sanctions Specific to Disciplinary Offenses

##### Section 1: Primary Sanctions

For Disciplinary Offenses, the Administrative Organ is authorized to impose any primary sanctions applicable to Administrative Offenses.

##### Section 2: Supplementary Disciplinary Sanctions
As an alternative to the standard Supplementary Administrative Sanctions, the Administrative Organ may impose one or more of the following Supplementary Disciplinary Sanctions for Disciplinary Offenses:

a) Restitution,

b) Temporary or Permanent Reassignment, or

c) Termination of Employment.

#### Article 34: Restitution

1. The Administrative Organ is empowered to mandate restitution by the perpetrator of a Disciplinary Offense that results in any form of damage to the Agency by which the perpetrator is employed, or to interests deemed significant by said Agency or by Liberland. The perpetrator may fulfill this obligation either during their regular working hours or by utilizing resources furnished by their employing Agency.

2. Should the perpetrator voluntarily choose to use their own resources to achieve restitution, such action will be interpreted as a positive sign of their commitment to rectify the infraction. However, the Administrative Organ shall not, under any circumstances, either directly or indirectly, require the use of personal resources for the purpose of a Restitution. Additionally, the absence of a personal contribution shall not be considered as an indication of unwillingness or incapacity to complete the required Restitution.

#### Article 35: Temporary or Permanent Reassignment as a Disciplinary Measure

##### Section 1: Criteria and Duration for Reassignment
1. If the perpetrator's conduct exhibits a blatant disregard for established protocols or basic prudence, and their ongoing role in their current position presents a likelihood of additional harm, the Administrative Organ is authorized to direct the Agent—subject to its disciplinary jurisdiction—to either a temporary or permanent reassignment within the same Agency or a temporary transfer to another Agency. The Agent may decline the reassignment, but such refusal could serve as a basis for termination.
2. The maximum duration for a Temporary Reassignment shall not exceed six consecutive months or a cumulative total of twelve months if the perpetrator's service in the new role is not continuous.
3. Permanent reassignment to a different Agency shall proceed only with the informed consent of the perpetrator. Lack of such consent shall not serve as grounds for termination; however, the reassignment will be temporary and limited to a maximum of six months, whether consecutively or in total.

##### Section 2: Rehabilitation Objectives
1. Where practicable, the perpetrator will be reassigned to a training role to address the skill deficiencies revealed by their Disciplinary Offense, or they may be subjected to psychological treatment along with lighter duties.
2. The overarching aim of any Temporary or Permanent Reassignment is the rehabilitation and full functional restoration of the perpetrator, as opposed to punitive measures.

#### Article 36: Termination of Employment
1. The Administrative Organ may terminate the employment or other relationship of an Agent with their respective Agency if the Agent's conduct:

   a) Demonstrates repeated, flagrant violations of established protocols or basic prudence or a constant alarming lack of basic skill required for the job;

   b) Poses an immediate and significant risk to the interests of Liberland or their Agency, already having caused significant level of damage to them; and

   c) Indicates a low likelihood of behavioral improvement, demonstrated by a stated or implicit unwillingness to make the required changes.

2. Termination of employment shall only be invoked when it is unequivocally evident that no lesser disciplinary measure will suffice to protect the assets or interests at risk due to the Agent's conduct. The primary objective of this disciplinary measure is to safeguard the interests and assets of Liberland, rather than to serve as a punitive action against the Agent.

### Title 4: Record of Delicts

#### Article 37: Keeping records of Delicts

##### Section 1: Record-Keeping Authority

1. The Ministry of Justice shall maintain a comprehensive record of all Delicts, including details of the perpetrators, sanctions imposed, severity, and other relevant circumstances.
2. Such records shall contain personal data and shall be governed by the provisions of the Information Law. After the prescribed period, these records shall be not discarded; rather they shall be archived, to be at the disposal of historians in an anonymised form and the Judiciary.

##### Section 2: Retention Period
1. Records of Delicts, in general, shall be retained for a period of ten years following the complete fulfilment of the imposed sanctions.
2. Records pertaining to Crimes shall be retained for a period ranging from ten to thirty years following the complete fulfilment of the imposed sanctions.
3. Records of Crimes against humanity, terrorism and war crimes shall be retained indefinitely.

#### Article 38: Privacy Considerations

##### Section 1: Confidentiality
1. Information regarding sanctions shall generally be confidential, shared only between the perpetrator and the Administrative Organ, unless the perpetrator provides prior, informed consent for its disclosure.
2. Information concerning other individuals involved in the record, such as witnesses, shall be subject to the same confidentiality provisions.

##### Section X2.2: Exceptions
Exceptions to these confidentiality provisions include the general legal authority granted to the Judiciary under the Information Law and specific legal licenses as defined by this Law.

#### Article 39: Legal Licenses for Information Disclosure

##### Section 1: Urgent Need
1. When approached by an individual or an Agent in situations deemed urgent—where the release of specific information could likely avert significant harm to the life, liberty, or property of identified persons—the Administrative Organ in possession of said information shall assess the validity and urgency of the need.
2. Should the Administrative Organ determine that the need is both valid and urgent, and that failure to disclose would render them at least partially culpable for ensuing significant danger or harm if they were a private entity, the Administrative Organ shall release the pertinent information to the requesting Agent or individual.
3. In cases where full disclosure may not be justified, but partial or anonymized information could mitigate some level of risk, the Administrative Organ shall release portions of the relevant information as dictated by the immediate needs of the situation.
