   a) Protecting the lives, health, or property of others in situations where significant property loss is clearly imminent or occurring, and the use of force is clearly likely to stop or mitigate the damage;

   b) Self-protection with respect to the Agent's life and health;

   c) Suppressing resistance against the execution of their official duty within limits judged reasonably necessary where significant damage or loss of life or health are at stake; and

When using a lethal weapon, the Agent shall aim to injure rather than kill the targeted person whenever possible without clearly compromising the purpose of the weapon use.
