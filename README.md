# üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Introduction - Laws

Welcome to the online source of the consolidated Laws of Liberland! Here we store drafted (interim) laws and draft new laws. **Note:** Interim laws refer to laws which are adopted by the _Cabinet_ rather than the (as of yet non-existent) referendum process.

We draft in Google Docs and, when a milestone is reached, a folder is made in this repository along with a Markdown version of the draft placed there. Adopting as an interim law is the last milestone for the time being, until a revision or final adoption by referendum.

Please open a draft from the list below to access the draft of a proposed law. To add your recommendation, please either open an Issue or simply create a pull request with the requested review. You can open an [Issue](https://github.com/liberland/laws/issues) to let us know what the problem or recommendation is.

Please go to [Discussions](https://github.com/liberland/laws/discussions) and start a discussion about your proposal, before or after you make it. To see the big picture of the drafting, please go to [Projects](https://github.com/liberland/laws/projects).

If you want to contribute, please [email us](justice@liberland.org) your GitHub handle to be added to this repo!
