# Judicial Process Law
## Preamble
WHEREAS, the principles of justice, fairness, and the rule of law are foundational to Liberland's administration of justice;

WHEREAS, the sanctity of private property in one's being, health, and possessions is a cornerstone of Liberland's values, realizable only through a judiciary adhering to modern jurisprudential best practices;

WHEREAS, the judiciary, in its duty, must exemplify fairness, impartiality, transparency, and competence, offering remedies under both Liberland's Constitution and valid public international law;

WHEREAS, the very essence of Liberland's libertarian core and mission is entrusted to the judiciary, recognized as the foremost state power in the Constitution;

WHEREAS, the Non-Aggression Principle, enshrined in the Constitution's inaugural book, mandates a consensual arbitrator to deter coercion and violence in conflict resolution, acting as civilization's chief safeguard;

WHEREAS, Liberland's mission, advocating for freedom-centric, decentralized cooperation, hinges on its judiciary's efficacy;

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ENACTED by the Citizens and the Government of Liberland:
## Chapter 1: Principles of just process

#### Article 3: Right to a fair trial
Every individual in Liberland has the right to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law. The principle of the right to a fair trial shall be upheld in all judicial processes, whether civil, criminal, or otherwise.

#### Article 4: Transparency and accessibility
1. All laws, regulations, and judicial procedural rules shall be publicly available and accessible so that potential parties may familiarize themselves with the legal framework governing the judicial process.
2. Court proceedings, decisions, and records shall be open to the public, except when confidentiality is necessary to protect the interests of justice or the rights and freedoms of the parties involved.

#### Article 5: Claim Preclusion and Issue Preclusion (Res Iudicata)
1. When a final Verdict in a given in a case between given parties and there is no longer the possibility for a regular Appeal, there can be no further Judiciary Process started, where

   a. the claim is based on the same transaction or the same situation that was at issue in the first action;
   
   b. the plaintiff seeks a different remedy, or further remedy, than was obtained in the first action; or
   
   c. the claim is of such nature as could have been joined in the first action.
   
3. A Judiciary Process can likewise not be started where the matter concerns solely issues of fact or law that have already been determined by a judge or jury as part of an earlier case.

#### Article 6: Litispendence
1. A Judiciary process will not be started when there is already a case pending in the exact same subject matter between the same Parties. 
2. The Applicant shall instead be invited to join the Applicant side of that preexisting Case.

#### Article 7: Judicial independence and impartiality
The judiciary in Liberland shall be independent of the executive and legislative branches of government and shall be impartial in the exercise of its functions. Judges shall be free from any external influence, inducement, pressure, threat, or interference, whether direct or indirect, in the performance of their duties.

#### Article 8: Competence and professionalism
1. All courts shall ensure that their officials, employees, and decision-makers receive appropriate training and maintain a high level of knowledge and skill throughout their tenure.
2. Judges, mediators, arbitrators, and other judicial decision-makers shall be well-versed professionals in the Law of Liberland and any other law or rules relevant to the jurisdiction of their respective courts.

#### Article 9: Expediency of Justice
##### Section 1: Speediness and fairness
1. Proceedings shall be conducted in a timely, efficient, and expedient manner. Cases shall be resolved promptly, efficiently, and swiftly from initiation to final resolution, without undue delay. 
2. Any judicial process shall be given a presumption of urgency, unless all parties explicitly indicate otherwise.
3. While expediting proceedings, care must be taken to maintain the integrity of the judicial process and the rights of the parties involved.
##### Section 2: Recourse against delays
1. Parties to a judicial proceeding may seek recourse if they experience unreasonable delays in the adjudication of their cases.
2. Such complaints shall be reviewed promptly, and appropriate actions shall be taken to address any identified shortcomings in the judicial process.

#### Article 10: Process Economy
1. Every decision within a process, as well as the overall setup of the process, shall be structured to minimize costs, unless the parties explicitly agree to a different arrangement.
2. Parties involved in a judicial proceeding have the right to seek recourse if they believe that this principle of cost minimization is not being adhered to. Complaints regarding potential breaches of this principle shall be:
   
   a. Reviewed promptly by the relevant judicial authority; and
   
   b. Addressed through appropriate measures to rectify any identified inefficiencies or excesses in the judicial process.

#### Article 11: Honour of the Court
1. The Court and all its representatives shall adhere to the standards of conduct befitting an honest and honourable institution.
2. Where they comply with the expected standard of behaviour and professionalism, mistreatment of court personnel shall be classified as Contempt of Court.

#### Article 12: Contempt of Court
1. A party, or any individual engaged in the Judicial Process, excluding the Judge, who
   
   a. commits an act or omission resulting in:
   
     i. Disrespect towards the court;
   
     ii. Interference with court proceedings; and
   
     iii. Undermining the authority of the court;
         when such conduct leads to tangible consequences such as increased Court Costs, procedural delays, or other damages incurred by the State or other parties involved; or
   
   b. Engages in an act for which Contempt of Court is prescribed as a consequence in this Law;
   shall be found in Contempt of Court.
   
3. Any individual adjudged in Contempt of Court shall be subject to a penalty. The penalty shall range from 150 LLM to 5000 LLM, commensurate with the gravity, contextual circumstances, and underlying motives of the contemptuous act.
4. First-time offenders will generally be subject to penalties at the lower spectrum of the aforementioned range. However, in cases where a first-time offender demonstrates a clear intent to refrain from future violations, and the resultant damage is relatively minor, an admonition may be issued in lieu of a pecuniary sanction.
5. Should an offender be found guilty of repeated serious Contempt of Court committed under aggravating circumstances or with serious consequences, and where further sanctions seem unlikely to lead to improvement in conduct, the Court may summarily dismiss the offender's case due to aggravated Contempt of Court.

#### Article 13: Judicial remedies
1. Courts in Liberland are empowered to provide a range of appropriate and effective remedies to safeguard and enforce the rights and interests of parties involved in legal disputes. These remedies include, but are not limited to, monetary compensation, injunctive relief, and declaratory relief.
2. In determining the nature of the remedy, the Court shall ensure that it is proportional to the circumstances of the case, considering the impact on all affected parties. The remedy must be under all circumstances fair, aiming directly to achieve justice between the parties involved in the specific case.
3. Remedies that fail to adhere to both the letter and spirit of this article shall be deemed invalid from their inception. Furthermore, the issuance of such a remedy in bad faith shall subject the responsible judge to disciplinary actions and other liabilities.

#### Article 14: Language
##### Section 1: Liberlandish as the default process language
1. State courts shall communicate in Liberlandish, a dialect continuum of English, and parties are responsible for compliance. The Judge may direct otherwise, but only if all parties jointly agree to use a language other than Liberlandish.
2. When a party requests the service of a translator and/or interpreter, the Judge shall arrange that at the expense of the requesting party.

##### Section 2: Protection of a party with an impairment
1. When the protection of a party with an impairment, such as a party with a sensory impairment,
   
   a. requires interpretation or transcription to make the process understandable for that party, and
   
   b. the use of legal counsel is insufficient, or
   
   c. the party can prove that they have insufficient means to obtain such legal counsel,
      The judge shall waive the requirement for the party to cover the expenses for translation or interpretation services.
   
3. Additionally, the Judge shall make any necessary accommodations to allow the party to present their case reasonably.

## Chapter 2: Types of Judicial Process
#### Article 15: General Process
The judicial procedure for resolving private law disputes between parties is established as the standard method for conducting both judicial proceedings and other processes in all Courts and institutions of the State of Liberland, reflecting the classically liberal principles of the State. The procedure, as described in this Law, shall be known as the General Process.

#### Article 16: Special Processes
1. Special Processes, which are derived from the General Process, shall be established for judicial and administrative proceedings that necessitate distinct procedures. These procedures are to be specified either in this law or in special laws.
2. The purpose of these Special Processes is to cater to specific procedural needs that the General Process does not adequately address, thereby ensuring both efficiency and fairness in specialized contexts.
3. Each Special Process will:
   
   a. Be assigned a unique name; and
   
   b. have its particular distinctions and procedural framework explicitly detailed in a law.
   
#### Article 17: Delict Process
1. The Delict Process shall be established as a Special Process involving a dispute between Liberland and another party, where the private party is alleged to be in non-compliance with the legal system, and Liberland acts as the public accuser.
2. This process will apply special procedural rules aimed at protecting the victims, ensuring the consequent application of the principle “innocent until proven guilty”, and ensuring a higher standard of justice than the standard procedural rules.
3. The detailed procedural framework of the Delict Process shall be outlined in a specific law.

#### Article 18: Criminal Process
##### Section 1: Criminal Process
1. The Criminal Process shall be a special case of the Delict Process where the object of the process is the innocence or guilt and the punishment for a Crime, as defined by the Constitution.
2. Criminal cases shall not be adjudicated by any Private Court. Any regulation, judicial decision, international treaty or contractual agreements that attempt to override this provision shall be null and void.

##### Section 2: Temporary adoption of the Croatian Criminal Process
1. Until a court and criminal police system meeting modern standards of criminal justice and police work can be established, Liberland shall accept the criminal jurisdiction of Croatian courts in matters related to Crimes.
2. Liberland shall not establish its own Criminal Process or criminal Courts for the time being, and neither shall it adjudicate Crimes itself, deferring instead to Croatian criminal law and the Croatian criminal justice system.
3. Liberland shall retain in full the authority to process and punish all other Delicts and disciplinary matters and shall establish organs to prosecute their perpetrators, including general and specialized Courts.

#### Article 19: Private Courts and alternative dispute resolution
##### Section 1: Power of the Private Courts
1. Private courts, arbitration, mediation, and other alternative dispute resolution mechanisms may be established and operated within the territory of Liberland, subject to the general principles and minimum requirements set forth in this law.
2. Private courts shall have the power to resolve disputes between willing parties in accordance with the agreed-upon rules and procedures, provided that they do not violate the fundamental principles of justice and fairness enshrined in this law and the Constitution of Liberland.

##### Section 2: Jurisdiction of the Private Courts
1. Jurisdiction of Private Courts shall be established exclusively on the basis of informed consent, mutually accorded by all parties to a dispute. This consent must typically originate from a contractual relationship or be explicitly declared by a party, in such a manner that the jurisdictional basis can be assumed to be unequivocally understood and acknowledged by the other party. 
2. Absent such mutual consent or clear acknowledgment, Private Courts shall not assume jurisdiction and the matter will be deferred to the appropriate State Court.
   
#### Article 20: Disciplinary Process
1. A Disciplinary Process is hereby established, whereby
   
   a. a State Court is authorized to adjudicate cases between the State of Liberland, any of its branches or organizations, or

   b. a Private Court is authorized to adjudicate cases between the community organizing the Private Court, or their respective representatives,
   
      as the accusing party, and a private entity or individual bearing a previously voluntarily assumed disciplinary responsibility to the accuser as the defendant.
   
3. The Disciplinary Process shall address cases concerning alleged non-compliance by the private party with rules, laws, or traditions set by the State, its branches, organizations, or the community that established the Private Court.
4. This process is applicable in instances where the alleged non-compliance does not fall under the category of other Delict types as defined in law.

## Chapter 3: Core Concepts
### Title 1: Parties
#### Article 21: Applicant and Defendant
##### Section 1: Fundamental Parties
The fundamental Parties to any judicial proceeding shall be the Applicant and the Defendant.

   a. The Applicant shall be the party initiating the legal action; and
   
   b. The Defendant shall be the party against whom the legal action is initiated.

##### Section 2: Multiple Applicants or Defendants
1. In cases involving multiple Applicants or Defendants, the Court shall endeavor to address each party individually, wherever feasible.
2. In situations where individual treatment of parties is impossible or clearly very impractical and incurring unproportionally high costs, the Court shall exercise its discretion in deciding whose location or circumstances to prioritize for procedural steps or decisions. The Court's decision shall be guided by the following criteria, applied in the order listed:
   
   a. Priority is given to protecting the more vulnerable party, as objectively determined by the Court. The criteria for vulnerability shall be explicitly stated in the Court's decision. In cases of equal standing, the Defendant is presumed to be the more vulnerable party.
   
   b. Consideration is given to the party with the most at stake in the dispute, encompassing all related cases, regardless of their nature (disciplinary, civil, criminal).
   
   c. In disputes between a natural person and a legal entity, preference is given to the natural person.
   
   d. If none of the above criteria are applicable, precedence is given to the first Applicant or Defendant in instances where additional parties joined the case subsequently.

#### Article 22: Involvement of Non-Principal Parties
1. Judicial proceedings may frequently involve parties who do not qualify as either Applicants or Defendants. Such parties shall be aligned with the side that has summoned them to the proceedings or the side for whose benefit they are acting.
2. In instances where a party's alignment is not clearly discernable, such party shall be deemed neutral for the purposes of the proceedings.

#### Article 23: Competency for natural persons
1. Natural persons are normally presumed to possess the competency to represent themselves in court proceedings. This presumption shall stand unless and until a contrary determination is made by the Court, following due process.
2. Natural persons diagnosed by reputable medical institutions with conditions that substantially impair their ability to comprehend or make informed decisions in legal contexts shall be presumed incompetent for self-representation. This presumption of incompetence shall similarly apply to individuals under the age of fifteen years.
3. In instances where a natural person is adjudged incapable of self-representation, the Court shall appoint a legal representative for such individual. The costs associated with this legal representation shall be borne by the individual in question, except in the case of minors, wherein financial responsibility shall fall upon their parents or legal guardians. 
4. Parents or legal guardians may also serve as the legal representatives for persons who do not possess the competency to represent themselves in court proceedings.

#### Article 24: Competency for Legal Entities
1. Legal Entities shall be represented by natural persons designated in their foundational documents as responsible for their representation. 
2. In cases of ambiguity, the natural person occupying the highest position in the Legal Entity’s management hierarchy shall act as its representative.

#### Article 25: Legal Representation
1. A Party, be it an individual or an entity or a group of Parties, shall have the right to appoint a chosen representative to act in their stead before the Court. Such an appointment must be formalized in writing.
2. A representative can be given general powers to represent the Party for the entirety of the process and for all process actions, or specific powers for a particular action or a set of action or a section of the process.
3. The Court shall extend equal respect and consideration to all appointed representatives, irrespective of their designated role or title.
#### Article 26: Substitution of Parties
##### Section 1: Grounds for Substitution
A party may be substituted in a judicial proceeding under the following circumstances:

   a. Death of a party, 
   
   b. Succession of a party that is an entity;   
   
   c. Insolvency or bankruptcy of a party;
   
   d. Assignment or transfer of interest;
   
   e. Merger or acquisition affecting a party that is an entity;
   
   f. Other circumstances as deemed appropriate by the Court.
   
##### Section 2: Procedure for Substitution
1. A motion for substitution must be filed by the substituting party or the remaining party, detailing the grounds for substitution.
2. Notice of the motion shall be served to all parties involved in the case.
3. The Court shall evaluate the motion and may require evidence or additional information before granting or rejecting substitution.
4. Upon approval, the substituting party shall assume all rights and responsibilities of the original party from the point of substitution.

##### Section 3: Effect of Substitution
The substitution of a party shall not affect the prior proceedings of the case, nor shall it necessitate the repetition of any completed procedural steps, unless otherwise ordered by the Court.

#### Article 27: Withdrawal
##### Section 1: Rules for Withdrawal
1. Any party may withdraw their application, defence, or participation at any stage, subject to the Court's approval.
2. A party may withdraw their application, defence, or participation before the delivery of documents to any other party by simply informing the Judge.

##### Section 2: Consequences of Withdrawal
1. If a Party on one side withdraws while other Parties on that side remain, the process will continue. The withdrawing Party is not exempt from the consequences of the final Decision or other measures taken by the Court.
2. If the last Applicant withdraws, the case will terminate in favour of the Defendant. If no Defendants are present, the case will simply end, but the obligation to pay Court costs persists.
3. Withdrawal by the last defending Party will generally lead to full acknowledgement of the Applicant's claims, subject to the Judge's discretion in cases where the Applicant's claims are manifestly unreasonable or unjust.
4. Withdrawal may result in liability of the withdrawing Party for costs incurred by other Parties on the same side directly as a result of the withdrawal. This will be determined by the Judge before the withdrawal is approved and the withdrawing Party can take back their withdrawal when faced with those costs.
   
##### Section 3: Repeated Case and Formal Considerations
1. Withdrawal does not preclude the Parties from initiating a new action on the same matter before it is adjudicated. Repeated withdrawal and re-application may be dismissed as vexatious if the intent is clearly to delay or disrupt the proceedings.
2. Requests for withdrawal must be submitted in writing and may be subject to the Court's discretion to ensure fairness and the administration of justice.

#### Article 28: Third-Party Intervention
##### Section 1: Right to Intervene
A third party may seek to join in an ongoing judicial proceeding under the following conditions:

   a. The third-party claims an interest relating to the subject matter of the case;
   
   b. The disposition of the case may impair the third party's ability to protect that interest; and
   
   c. The third party's interest is not adequately represented by the existing parties.

##### Section 2: Procedure for Intervention
1. A motion for joining must be filed by the third party, detailing the nature of their interest and the grounds for the joining. They shall indicate which side they wish to join: Applicant, Defendant or as a neutral, and shall reason out why they are making this motion.
2. Notice of the motion shall be served to all existing parties.
3. The Court shall evaluate the motion and may require evidence or additional information before granting the right to join.

##### Section 3: Role and Responsibilities
Once the right to join is granted, the joining party shall be bound by the same rules, rights, and responsibilities as if they were an original party to the case on their respective side.

### Title 2: Judges
#### Article 29: Role of the Judge
##### Section 1: Judicial Authority
1. The Judge serves as the official conduit through which a court exercises its functions in matters related to the judicial process.
2. A Judge or panel of Judges presides over any judicial process and renders the final decision to resolve any dispute, question, or other matter presented before the court.

##### Section 2: The Judge Knows the Law
1. A Judge presiding over a court proceeding is presumed to be knowledgeable in all aspects of Law relevant to making decisions in that proceeding, unless proven otherwise.
2. The Judge also serves as the final arbiter in determining the correct procedure for every situation that arises before the court.

#### Article 30: Qualifications of the Judge
##### Section 1: General Qualifications
Authorities responsible for the appointment of Judges must ensure that appointees possess the necessary legal knowledge and competence to perform judicial duties in the specific context of the Court, panel, or types of processes they are expected to adjudicate.

##### Section 2: Invalid Appointments and Sanctions
1. Appointments made with knowledge or suspicion that the appointee lacks the necessary legal qualifications shall be deemed invalid.
2. Such invalid appointments shall incur disciplinary and other sanctions, regardless of any other positive attributes the individual may possess.

##### Section 3: Exceptional Circumstances
1. In cases where qualified legal professionals are objectively scarce, the responsible authorities may appoint the most competent individuals available.
2. Such authorities must notify the Ministry of Justice of these appointments. The Ministry of Justice reserves the right to reject such appointments without unnecessary delays in maximal 15 days after the notification if the reasons provided are insufficient or if the appointee clearly lacks the basic ability to perform their duties.

#### Article 31: Composition of Judicial Panels
##### Section 1: Number of Judges and Decision-Making
1. In cases presided over by multiple Judges, the Judicial Panel shall consist of an odd number of Judges.
2. In general, all Judges on a Judicial Panel shall have equal decision-making power.
3. In the event of a tie, one designated Judge on the Judicial Panel shall have the deciding vote.

##### Section 2: Voting Procedure
1. In general voting procedures, whether on a decision, order, warrant or a process measure, the Judge with the highest seniority shall cast their vote first, followed by the remaining Judges in descending order of seniority.
2. In voting concerning criminal law, delicts, or any form of disciplinary action involving the determination of guilt or innocence, the most junior Judge shall cast their vote first. Voting shall then proceed in ascending order of seniority, culminating with the most senior Judge.
   
#### Article 32: Assigning Judges
1. Each court shall establish rules according to which Judges are assigned to cases and shall respect those rules in all matters.
2. No party shall be deprived of a Judge assigned to them, except
   
    a. where the party gives their express permission or
   
    b. in cases where objective circumstances beyond the Party’s or the Court’s control prevent this, for instance, the death or a serious illness of the Judge.

#### Article 33: Impartiality
1. The Judge shall act impartially and in the interest of justice, upholding legitimately obtained private property and being mindful of the personal situations of the parties and their power differences.
2. If a party suspects partiality, they may appeal to the court, which shall appoint three Judges to decide on the impartiality of the fellow Judge. A Judge in self-doubt of being partial may also initiate this process themselves.

#### Article 34: Partial Judges
##### Section 1: General rules on Partiality
A Judge who has a personal connection to one or more of the parties or the object of the case shall be deemed partial where that connection is Judged sufficient to influence their decision-making.

##### Section 2: Consequences for Partial Judges
1. A partial Judge shall be replaced according to the rules of the court. 
2. Partiality in itself shall not be counted against the Judge without it having led to unjust decisions or breaches of due process or without it having been found in aggravating circumstances, in particular that the Judge must have known that they were partial and has not reported it, or Judges accepting bribes or undue gifts or lending. Only judges found partial in aggravating circumstances might be considered for Disciplinary measures.
3. Reporting Partiality in self-doubt will be an extenuating circumstance where Disciplinary measures are considered in case of aggravating circumstances.
4. The Court or a higher Court, where applicable, shall re-examine a judicial decision made and a judicial process presided by a partial Judge, regardless of the procedural stage at which partiality has been established.

##### Section 3: Prohibition of accepting bribes
1. Judges are strictly prohibited from accepting any form of bribe, whether monetary or non-monetary, to influence their judgment, even if intended to favor the meritorious party. A Judge found having accepted a bribe shall be deemed Partial unless proven otherwise with an extreme level of certainty.
2. Any accepted bribe shall be returned to the giver upon demand. 
3. Both the recipient and giver of the bribe shall be liable for a Delict and the Judge shall be suspended from their duties and replaced and subject to strict disciplinary measures which may involve the Judge’s dismissal.

##### Section 4: Restriction on accepting gifts and lending
1. Gifts accepted from any party or their representative or any connected party shall be considered bribes. 
2. Gifts accepted before the process starts may be grounds to declare partiality where these are judged as sufficient to possibly influence the Judge.
3. A judge shall be partial for any case involving a party from whom they have borrowed, unless the borrowing is part of a regular, reciprocal exchange clearly unrelated to the case at hand.

#### Article 35: No communication outside the proper channels
After a case has commenced, there shall be, outside of legally prescribed forms of communication, no other communication between the Judge and the parties or between the court and other persons relevant to the case, such as witnesses, unless explicitly permitted by consent of all parties.

### Title 3: Judicial Decisions  
#### Article 36: Standards of decision-making
1. The Judge shall base each statement in any Verdict on evidence and well-reasoned logic only and according to law and principles of justice. 
2. A Judge may not refuse to render a final Verdict or any other decision prescribed by the judicial process rules applicable once assigned to a case. The decision becomes binding upon the court once signed by the Judge.

#### Article 37: Absolute Material Truth
1. The judicial decision-making and judicial proceedings in their entirety shall adhere to the principle of absolute material truth. No legal provision shall be placed above the truth in the pursuit of justice.
2. Therefore, no formal rules shall govern the admissibility or interpretation of evidence that would derogate from the best available practices of evaluation and interpretation of evidence. 
3. All evidence, even if obtained in gross violation of law or ethics, shall be assessed objectively and based on its specific context and likelihood of accuracy. No evidence shall be made absolutely inadmissible on formal grounds or on principle.

#### Article 38: Consideration of Evidence
1. In making judicial decisions, the Judge shall evaluate each piece of evidence individually, considering both its origins and its relevance to the claims it is intended to support. 
2. The Judge is obligated to provide a reasoned explanation for their decisions, thoroughly evaluating the facts of the case according to their best judgment.

#### Article 39: The Verdict
##### Section 1: Purpose of the Verdict
1. The final decision in every case shall be the Verdict, issued by the Judge or the Judicial Panel.

2. The Verdict shall provide detailed reasoning for each decision and its components, based on:
   
    a. Applicable legal provisions;
   
    b. Doctrine; and
   
    c. Where necessary, commonly upheld principles of justice as are adhered to in civilized countries.

##### Section 3: Issuing the Verdict
1. The verbal form of the Verdict shall be issued on the last day of the process. Parties may generally assume that this form will stand, barring an appeal, and may act accordingly upon hearing it.
2. The written form of the Verdict, which will not differ significantly from the verbal form, shall be delivered to the Parties within 5 days after the conclusion of the proceedings.
3. Where possible, the Judge will try to provide an ex tempore Verdict, meaning that the Parties receive the written version of the Verdict on the same day as the verbal form of the Verdict is declared.
4. In exceptional circumstances, such as force majeure or extreme complexity, extensions for issuing or drafting the written form may be necessary. Such extensions shall be communicated to the Parties without delay. The time to file an Appeal against the Verdict shall be extended by the number of days the delay took.
5. Under no circumstances shall a Verdict be delivered later than 15 workdays after the last day of the process.

##### Section 4: Right to Appeal
1. All Parties have the right to appeal the Verdict.
2. Appeals must be filed within 8 workdays after the written Verdict is delivered to the given Party.

##### Section 5: Legal Force
1. The Verdict gains legal force either after the expiration of the appeal period or once the appeal process has concluded and affirmed the Verdict. At this point, the parties shall be required to comply with the final Verdict. 
2. Upon the Verdict gaining legal force, the Court shall promptly undertake all feasible measures to execute the decision. This may include issuing orders for the payment of damages, seizing collateral, redistributing pooled LLM balances, and by Judicial Directive ordering  specific actions or cessation thereof.
3. A Party who is in found in disobedience to a Verdict or to one of the decision stated in it shall be subject to a penalty. The penalty shall range from 500 LLM to 50 000 LLM depending on the severity of the disobedience and its impact on others and their rights.

#### Article 40: Issuing Warrants
1. A Judge may issue a warrant to
   
    a. have privately owned premises searched,
   
    b. have an item or a monetary amount seized,
   
    c. arrest, restrict or dictate the movement of a person, in order to facilitate the effectiveness of a judiciary process about them, or
   
    d. regulate matters between the parties in a temporary fashion, in order to ensure the stability of the object of the judiciary process.
   
    e. permit law enforcement and intelligence agencies to access secure communications that would otherwise be deemed an invasion of privacy.
   
3. A Judge may only issue a warrant upon probable cause supported by sufficiently specific evidence. A Warrant must be sufficiently specifically worded, describing the person or objects concerned, the place of application and the time window of intended application. 
#### Article 41: Types of Warrants
##### Section 1: Warrants executed by Law Enforcement
The following types of Warrants shall be executed by Law Enforcement:
   
    a. Search Warrants: A search warrant authorizes Law Enforcement Officers to search a specific location for specific items and to seize those items if found.

    b. Arrest Warrants: An arrest warrant authorizes Law Enforcement Officers to arrest a specific individual based on probable cause that the individual has committed a crime.
    
    c. Bench Warrants: A bench warrant is issued by a Judge when a defendant fails to appear in court as required. This authorizes Law Enforcement Officers to arrest the defendant and bring them to court.

##### Section 2: Judicial Orders
1. Judicial Orders, a distinct category of Warrant, shall be executed by Law Enforcement or other designated State organs. These Orders are crafted to temporarily alter the conditions of parties engaged in a legal dispute. This may involve the imposition of temporary prohibitions or mandates, with the objective of stabilizing the situation to facilitate effective legal adjudication.
2. Judicial Orders shall not compel individuals to undertake actions within the scope of other Warrant Types. Non-compliance with these Orders shall be addressed through the application of Delict and corresponding sanctions, as opposed to the direct exertion of force or the threat thereof.

#### Article 42: Execution of Warrants
##### Section 1: Process of execution for Warrants
1. Organs responsible for the execution of Warrants, henceforth “Responsible Organs”, shall execute warrants in accordance with the terms of the warrant and applicable laws and regulations. When executing a warrant, the responsible organ shall identify themselves, present the warrant to the person subject to the warrant or the occupant of the place to be searched, and provide a receipt for any property seized.
2. In exigent circumstances, where there is a risk of imminent harm to persons, destruction of evidence, or flight of a suspect, Law Enforcement Officers may take necessary actions without a warrant, provided that they subsequently obtain a warrant or present the circumstances to a Judge for review.

##### Section 2: Reporting and oversight
1. Responsible organs, in particular Law Enforcement Agencies, shall maintain records of all warrants issued and executed relevant to their activities, including the basis for the warrant, the items seized, and the outcome of any related proceedings.

3. The mediator's role is to facilitate constructive interaction and open communication, while also evaluating issues and norms without providing prescriptive advice, but not to enforce a Verdict or a resolution. The resolution will instead be agreed upon by the Parties as a matter of reaching a compromise.

1. Mediation takes place in mediation instances and according to their rules, which are outside the scope of this law, but may be legislated by a special law. 
2. The Judge will only delegate the case to a provably professional Mediation instance which uses state of the art and standard mediation techniques and is free of major scandals. This instance may be based outside of Liberland.

#### Article 60: Proposal of Mediation
1. In controversial cases, the Judge will always propose Mediation to the parties. The Parties may disagree, and if at least one Party disagree, in general, the case moves on to the Trial phase.
2. Where a Party or more Parties disagree and the Judge sees that the Mediation is required for the advancement of Justice, the Judge may order the first Mediation session to take place and the Parties must attend and dutifully take part in good faith, or they are in contempt of the Court. 
3. The Parties are obliged to evaluate the merits of the Mediation objectively and may, based on this evaluation, agree to participate in or reject further Mediation sessions. Upon rejection by at least one Party, the process moves to the
Trial phase.

#### Article 61: Duties of the Mediation instance

2. The Mediation instance shall meticulously document detailed minutes of all proceedings. Periodic reports, inclusive of these minutes, are to be submitted to the Court in a timely manner.

Parties must engage in good faith during mediation. This includes active discussion, information exchange, and consideration of proposals.

#### Article 63: Settlement and Court approval
##### Section 1: Submission and Court review of settlements
All settlements achieved through mediation shall be presented to the Court for approval. The Court shall assess each settlement for consistency with the mediation process, formal accuracy, and adherence to principles of justice.

    d. the indication of the parties specified and who is applicant and who is defendant, and
    e. the date and manner of the required court appearance.

Parties unable to attend due to exigent circumstances must inform the court in advance and request rescheduling.
Title 2: Order of the Trial
Initiating the Trial Proceedings
At the initiation of trial proceedings, the presiding Judge shall methodically outline the principal elements and historical context of the case under consideration.
This exposition shall encompass an exhaustive overview of the case's nature, explicitly identify the distinct issues necessitating resolution, and provide an in-depth account of the procedural steps preceding the trial's commencement.
Where the case involves unique procedural deviations that parties might reasonably perceive as atypical, the presiding Judge is mandated to disclose such deviations at the onset of the trial proceedings.
Applicant's Case Presentation
The applicant presents their case first, summarizing arguments, intended evidence, and sought relief in an opening statement.
The applicant may in their presentation name and introduce witnesses, present and introduce the relevant documentary evidence, and make legal submissions to support their case.
Respondent's Case Presentation
The Respondent presents their case after the applicant concludes and they shall follow the same rules and enjoy the same freedom as an Applicant does in their presentation.
Rebuttal and Rejoinder Procedures
Upon the conclusion of the Respondent's presentation, the Applicant is entitled to submit a Rebuttal. This Rebuttal aims to address any new issues or evidence introduced by the Respondent, ensuring a comprehensive and fair consideration of all relevant aspects of the case.
Following the Applicant's Rebuttal, the Respondent is granted the opportunity to present a Rejoinder. The purpose of the Rejoinder is to respond specifically to the points raised in the Applicant's Rebuttal and to introduce any additional arguments or evidence that are directly pertinent to the issues highlighted in the Rebuttal.
Initiation and response to claims
Following the opening statements and the Rebuttal and the Rejoinder, Parties shall have the opportunity to further initiate claims relevant to the Case.
The opposing Party shall have the right to respond to these claims, either by accepting, denying, or providing a counterclaim.
All claims and counterclaims must be clearly articulated and relevant to the Case at hand.
Title 3: Evidence and Argumentation Procedures
Presentation of Evidence
Section 1: Duty to make claims supported by evidence
Parties must support their claims with evidence, disclosed to both the Judge and the opposing party during the hearing. 
The presentation should be clear enough for an uninformed observer to understand the argumentation and the supporting evidence. 
Parties can submit evidence as they see fit, provided it is respecting the general principles of court proceedings and doesn’t endanger anyone or their property. 
Section 2: Rights of the Judge regarding evidence presentation
The presiding Judge retains the discretion to mandate the Parties to furnish supplementary evidence, should they deem a statement crucial to the case inadequately substantiated by existing evidence. 
A Party may decline such a request; however, this refusal could potentially lead to the dismissal of their case. While this may prolong the duration of the Trial, it shall be invoked no more than once per hearing.
The Judge may vary the evidence presentation procedure to ensure equal opportunity for all parties to present relevant material. 
The Judge is empowered to reprimand a Party and where this is not respected to impose sanctions for Contempt of Court on claims that are repeatedly illogical, absurd, or unsubstantiated, particularly when such claims are evidently not proffered in good faith.
Dismissal of Unsupported Claims
The Judge may freely dismiss and ignore claims if they are presented without any supporting evidence.
Matters of Law and Common Knowledge
The Judge may accept without Parties providing evidence generally undisputed facts, such as that the Sun rises in the east, matters of law, or facts agreed upon by both parties. 
Examination of Witnesses
All Parties shall have the right and shall be given the opportunity to indicate, invite and examine witnesses before the Judge. Parties may examine both their witnesses and those invited by the counterparty.
The names and addresses of all witnesses shall be recorded as part of the case record.
Handling of Exhibits
Parties shall have the right and opportunity to present material evidence as exhibits. Exhibits offered by any Party shall be accepted into evidence and appropriately marked and evaluated.
Descriptions of exhibits, in the order they are received, shall be included in the case record.
Experts, ancillary persons and material aids
In addition to witnesses and evidence, parties may introduce into the trial other individuals and items, under the condition that these are either direct conveyors of evidentiary information or are to be utilized for the enhancement of extracting or interpreting such information from the existing evidence.
The presentation of such individuals or items without prior registration with the court shall incur sanctions for  contempt of court.
All proceedings before the court involving such individuals or items must be duly registered and recorded in the court's official records.
Party collaboration
Section 1: Disclosure of special considerations
Parties to a proceeding shall actively and diligently engage in the process of evidence procurement and examination. This includes facilitating an effective and objective analysis of evidence, thereby enabling the Court to extract pertinent information for adjudication.
Specifically, parties are obligated to disclose, without delay, any specialized requirements related to the examination of evidence. This encompasses, but is not limited to, the involvement of witnesses, the presentation of material evidence, the inclusion of expert testimony, the participation of ancillary individuals or entities, and the utilization of any necessary material aids.
Failure to comply with this directive may result in sanctions for contempt of court, particularly in instances where non-compliance engenders procedural complications.
Section 2: Judiciary license not to rectify party negligence
In the event that comprehensive evidence examination is impeded due to a party's non-cooperation, the presiding judge shall retain the discretion to adjudicate based on the verifiable facts derived from the said evidence as it was presented. 
In such circumstances, the judge is not obligated to compensate with extra effort for the non-compliant party's lack of cooperation.
Title 4: Closing the Trial
Closing Arguments
After all presentations, rebuttals, and claims, parties may make closing arguments.
The applicant goes first, summarizing key points and highlighting persuasive evidence or legal submissions.
The respondent follows, summarizing their defense and addressing issues raised in the applicant's closing argument.
Trial Extension
The Judge may exceptionally extend the Trial for serious reasons, clearly communicated to the parties.
Extensions may be party-requested or Judge-initiated, but only if necessary for high-quality decision-making.
A case may be extended no more than twice, and only for just and efficient resolution.
Upon extension, the Judge will promptly issue new summons for the extended hearing date which shall not be later than 15 days after the date of the previous hearing.
Deliberation and the Verdict
Once the main hearing has concluded, the presiding Judge or the Judicial Pannel shall deliberate on the evidence and arguments presented by the parties.
The court shall consider the facts, the applicable law, and the principles of justice and fairness in reaching a decision on the Verdict. 
The deliberations shall be conducted in such a way that the Verdict can be announced in a timely manner, but, where possible, the Judges shall strive for providing an ex tempore Verdict.
After the decision has been made and documented, the Judge or Judicial Pannel shall return to the space in which the Trial is being conducted and announce the Verdict.
Informing Parties and Addressing Administrative Matters
Upon announcing the Verdict, the Judge or the presiding Judge of the Judicial Pannel shall  inform the Parties of their right to appeal the decision, the procedures for filing an appeal, and any relevant deadlines or time limits for doing so. This shall also be recorded in writing on the written form of the Verdict. 
The Court shall also address any remaining procedural or administrative matters, including the allocation of costs and the submission of any additional documents or information required for the implementation of the Court's decision.
Chapter 6: Appeal
Appeals Process

A party that is dissatisfied with the Court's decision may file an appeal by the Court where the decision has been made. An Appeal shall have the same formal and content requirements as an Application, but it must address a Verdict.
The Appeal must claim a legal, processual or factual deficiency or deficiencies in a Verdict that was issued, but hasn’t yet gained legal force on the date of the Appeal’s delivery.
Remedial Process
Section 1: Correction of Errors in Decision
Upon examining an appeal, the court may correct the original decision for:
Mathematical errors,
Mistaken person descriptions,
Remedies based on unsubmitted issues that don't affect merits,
Form imperfections not affecting merits,
Value differentials less than 1 BTC or equivalent.
The Court will dismiss clearly frivolous or meritless appeals.
Section 2: Appeals against Remedial Decisions
Where a decision is made in the Remedial Process either by correcting the original decision or to dismiss a clearly frivolous or meritless Appeal, the Court will set a time span for 8 working days for the Party  to lodge an Objection against that decision. 
Where that Objection is logged, the original decision will not gain legal force and the Court will forward the original Appeal to the appropriate Court of Appeals.
Referral to Court of Appeal
If the appeal concerns matters other than those reserved for the Remedial Process and is not dismissed, the court prepares a statement and refers it to the appropriate Court of Appeal.
The Court will refer the case to the Court of Appeal, which shall be a Court in the hierarchy of State courts one step above the current court.  In circumstances where multiple Courts exist at this hierarchical level, the assignment of jurisdiction among them shall be governed by the same criteria and principles as those applied in the determination of jurisdiction for Courts of first instance.
Private Courts will refer to the Court of Appeal according to their own process law, and those Courts of Appeal can be located outside of Liberland or, conversely, can be State Courts. If that is the case, the Appeal will be adjudicated based on the law of Liberland.
Where no other higher Court is available, the Appeal will be heard by the Supreme Court according to the process rules concerning Appeals.
Review by the Appellate Court
Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the appellate court shall review the case record, including the lower court's decision, the evidence and arguments presented during the hearing, and any relevant procedural or evidentiary rulings.
The appellate process shall adhere to the General Process framework, with a predominant reliance on written submissions. Mediation shall not form part of the appellate procedure. The convening of a Trial shall be an exceptional measure only, reserved solely for instances deemed critically necessary for the just resolution of the Appeal.
The Appellate Court may request additional briefs or oral arguments from the parties to address specific issues or clarify particular points of law. 
The scope of the Appellate Court's review will be limited by the grounds for appeal raised by the appellant. In addition, it is not permissible for a party to claim facts or present evidence during the appellate review that were clearly available and present during the time of the original process, but through the fault of the party, were not presented before the court.
Appellate Verdict
Section 1: Standard forms of the Appelate Verdict
Upon examination of the case, the Court of Appeal shall render an Appelate Verdict in one of the following forms:
Affirmation of the original Verdict: This occurs when the Verdict is deemed formally and materially correct, or when the Appeal lacks substantive grounds.
Modification of the lower court's decision: Applicable in scenarios where practicality allows, typically in instances involving a singular error or a non-fundamental cluster of errors that do not undermine the entire Verdict.
Return the Case to the first instance Court: The case is sent back for further proceedings, and obligatory recommendations for the first instance Court to adhere to in subsequent deliberations will be included.
Section 2: Reversing the original Verdict
If a decision is fundamentally flawed in form, substance, or both, to the point where it cannot promote justice, the Appellate Court shall have the authority to Reverse it. This reversal renders the decision ineffective, eliminating concerns of litispendence or res judicata. 
Upon issuance of the Reversal Verdict, the Court will ask the Party whether it wishes to repeat the process. If the Party opts to continue the same case, the Appellate Court will either assign it to a different court than the one which produced the original Verdict or, if this is unfeasible, rehear the case itself at the first instance.
Section 3: Formal and procedural consideration
The appellate court's Verdict shall be accompanied by a written explanation of its reasoning, including its analysis of the legal issues, its evaluation of the lower court's factual findings, and any relevant procedural or evidentiary rulings. 
The appellate Verdict shall be binding on all lower Courts from which Appeal would be in principle possible to this Court of Appeals, and also on the parties. 
An Appeal against the Verdict of the Appellate Court is not permissible, and such a Verdict attains Legal Force upon the Delivery of its written form to a Party. However, should the outcome of the Appeal necessitate the reopening of the first instance process, the resulting Verdict from this reopened process shall be subject to the standard Appeals procedure.
Chapter 7: Supreme Court Review
Case Selection and Review Criteria
The Supreme Court has the authority to review cases from all judicial and quasi-judicial bodies in Liberland, including State, private, and public courts, as well as Administrative Organs or organizations engaged in similar processes. The Court may also review organizations that should, but currently do not, use such processes. In ambiguous situations, the Court has the discretion to undertake a review.
The initiation of a review may come from a petition by involved parties or be autonomously decided by the Court. There is no automatic right to a Supreme Court review; the choice rests solely with the justices.
The Court prioritizes cases that question the validity of treaties or laws.
Cases either in the appellate process or, in exceptional circumstances, in the first instance, may also be considered for review.
Time Limitation for Case Review
The Supreme Court generally will not review cases where the Verdict gained legal force more than ten years ago.
Exceptions are made in extraordinary circumstances, such as strong indications of gross injustice with significant consequences for the parties, the justice system, or individual liberty in Liberland.
Case Documentation and Party Notification
The court that last adjudicated the case or is currently hearing it shall compile detailed documentation and promptly submit it to the Supreme Court.
The applicant and other parties are notified and instructed to prepare an addendum to their application or response within 30 days. The applicant in the original process can reject the review, and then it will not take place.
Supreme Court Process Structure
The Supreme Court process generally follows the structure of the regular judicial process.
Justices may choose to modify any phase of the process as they deem necessary, informing parties prior to the commencement of proceedings, and they will give sufficient reasoning. After the process has started, there shall be no more modifications.
A decision to modify process rules for a certain case becomes precedent for the given type of case which binds further Supreme Court reviews and, where applicable, all the lower courts.
Application Modification and Withdrawal
Once notified of a Supreme Court review, applicants may not withdraw their applications.
Any modifications to the application are subject to the Supreme Court’s discretion and sense of justice.
Evidence and Decision Autonomy
Unlike with the Appeals Process, the Supreme Court has the discretion to admit or dismiss any new facts and evidence, even if they were known during previous stages.
The Supreme Court has complete autonomy in its decision-making and may disregard any aspect of the previous processes as it sees fit.
Supreme Court Verdict
The Supreme Court Verdict is final and not subject to appeal or any other form of legal recourse.
The Verdict gains immediate legal force upon communication in writing to a Party.
Chapter 8: Constitutional Control and Recourse
Disregarding unconstitutional and illegal provisions
When adjudicating a case, a Judge has the authority to invalidate any provision of a law if it is determined that there exists no reasonable interpretation that would make the provision consistent with both the letter and spirit of the Constitution. In doing so, the Judge provides the affected Party with the Constitutional Recourse they are entitled to.
Similarly, a Judge is empowered to annul any provision within a Regulation that is found to be incongruent with either the Constitution or the applicable Laws of the Free Republic of Liberland, applying the same evaluative criteria as for statutory provisions.
Minimalist approach
Although a Judge possesses the authority to set aside an entire Law or Regulation through the exercise of Constitutional Recourse, the Judge shall always opt for the solution that fully resolves the constitutional or legal conflict while minimally altering the existing Law or Regulation. 
Exceptions are possible only when all the possible minimalistic solutions are clearly unjust or patently absurd.
Qualified Discrepancy
The presiding Judge of the Court, where the Verdict with Recourse was issued, shall collaborate with the Judge who initially invoked the Recourse. They shall determine whether the identified constitutional or legal discrepancy substantially and negatively affects the dispensation of justice or individual liberty in the Free Republic of Liberland, termed as a "Qualified Discrepancy." 
Should the presiding Judge be the one who invoked the Recourse, they shall undertake this assessment independently.
Upon determination of a Qualified Discrepancy, the Judges shall collaboratively draft and submit a petition for legislative correction to Congress. If the discrepancy involves a Regulation's inconsistency with a Law or the Constitution, the petition is directed to the body that promulgated the Regulation.
Repeal or amendment process
Upon receipt of a petition identifying a Qualified Discrepancy, the Issuing Authority shall draft an amendment or a new Law or Regulation to rectify the identified issue. Extensive consultation with the petitioning Judges shall be conducted throughout this process.
The proposed resolution shall only be deemed valid if there is mutual agreement between the Issuing Authority and the consulting Judges that the Qualified Discrepancy has been adequately addressed.
If the Qualified Discrepancy remains unresolved 20 days after the petition's delivery, the following actions shall automatically occur:
The Law or Regulation in question shall revert to its state as of the date the petition was drafted.
The Qualified Discrepancy as agreed during the last round of consultation before the time limit passes shall be applied upon the Law or Regulation.
Qualified Discrepancy on Recourse where minimalism wasn’t applied
In instances where the Issuing Authority believes that the exercise of Recourse deviates from the principle of minimalism, they shall formally communicate their concerns to the Judges, accompanied by recommendations for rectification.
Upon receipt of such notification, Judges are required to re-evaluate the Qualified Discrepancy in accordance with the provided recommendations. Alternatively, Judges must furnish a comprehensive justification affirming the alignment of their original decision with the minimalistic approach mandated by this Law.
If, following this revision, Congress or the issuing regulatory body continues to regard the Qualified Discrepancy as non-compliant with this Law, they reserve the right to annul the Qualified Discrepancy on the grounds of non-conformity.
In situations of persistent disagreement, the Judges who adjudicated the Qualified Discrepancy are authorized to refer the matter to the Supreme Court for a conclusive interpretation of this provision. The Supreme Court is obliged to treat these referrals with the highest level of priority, prioritizing disputes related to Laws over those concerning Regulations.
Supreme Court Constitutional Control
Section 1: Supreme Court Review
The Supreme Court is empowered to review any proposed Law, Regulation or Decision, henceforth “Proposal”, during its drafting phase, and where applicable, its referendum stage, or enactment period. 
The Court shall scrutinize the Proposal for its compatibility with the Constitution.
For legislative proposals and Regulations or Decisions passing the Referendum, the Referendum or Enactment period shall be paused for the duration of this review.
The Supreme Court will generally prioritize the examination of Laws over Regulations and Decisions.
Section 2: Binding recommendations
If the Supreme Court identifies a discrepancy during the drafting phase, it shall issue Binding Recommendations to the drafting body.
The proposed Law, Regulation or Decision shall not be allowed to continue its legislative proces, unless and until all Binding Recommendations are fully addressed.
The Binding Recommendations shall constitute a precedent for any subsequent similar proposals and the Supreme Court will ensure that Proposals with similar flaws receive similar treatment and especially that they won’t be allowed to pass without undergoing Supreme Court Review.
Section 3: Consultations
The Issuing Authority shall have the right and the duty to consult with the justices of the Supreme Court to ensure compliance. The Supreme Court shall give response in 15 days after an invitation to consultation. 
The Supreme Court shall state beforehand the requirements for the content and form of such an invitation.
Section 4: Declaration of Constitutionality
In every case, the Supreme Court, once consulted and once it is satisfied with the solution, shall issue a Declaration of Constitutionality, which will release the instrument from further Supreme Court Review, provided it won’t further change.
Proposals that obtained a Declaration of Constitutionality shall continue the process from the point where the process had been paused for the Constitutional Review.
Chapter 9: Private Courts
Stated Objectives
The primary mandate of Private Courts in Liberland shall be to uphold and safeguard property rights as delineated in Book 1 of this Constitution and to provide equitable administration of justice according to the general principles of justice outlined in this law and in the appropriate doctrine, such as those are upheld by State Courts.
Ancillary objectives, such as safeguarding the integrity of a particular community, may be pursued provided they do not supersede the primary mandate.
Special consideration of Private Court Delictual jurisdiction
In matters of delicts, State Courts capable of assuming Appelate Jurisdiction and the Supreme Court reserve the right to assert State jurisdiction, superseding any existing contractual obligations between a Party and a Private Court, should the pursuit of justice necessitate such action.
Besides having no jurisdiction in Criminal matters, Private Courts are precluded from adjudicating delictual matters involving penalties or damages exceeding 5 BTC. 
Cases where State jurisdiction is asserted or where it must be assumed due to the size of the possible penalty, the Private Court shall transfer the Case without delay to a State Court of the asserting Court’s choosing or to the State Court of general jurisdiction of the Defendant, which shall restart the proceedings. 
While Private Courts retain the right to issue decisions regarding court costs incurred up until the point of transfer, this right applies only insofar as the Private Court acted in good faith in the pursuit of the case and could not have reasonably anticipated the necessity for the transfer of jurisdiction.
Constitutional Adherence
Private Courts are obligated to operate in strict compliance with the rights and freedoms enshrined in the Constitution, in the same way as State Courts are.
Regulatory Standards
The State retains the prerogative to impose minimum operational standards on Private Courts, encompassing aspects of fairness, equality, and accessibility to legal recourse.
Private Courts are mandated to disclose, in a public manner, the legal frameworks or rules under which they operate.
Mutual Recognition
Private Courts are obligated to recognize and enforce judgments rendered by State Courts and other Private Courts. 
This doesn’t preclude Private Courts from adjudicating appeals or similar processes regarding decision of other Private Courts. 
Supreme Court Oversight
All Private Courts shall recognize the Supreme Court as the ultimate appellate and general judicial authority, and its jurisprudence shall be binding upon all Private Courts.
Sanctions and Penalties
Any decision rendered in contravention of Book 1 of the Constitution or in violation of any rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution shall be deemed null and void.
The act of rendering a decision that is unconstitutional in bad faith shall constitute a Misdemeanor of the Court. If such an act is not the result of the Court’s systemic failure but attributed to an individual Judge, the penalty imposed shall range from 5,000 to 50,000 Liberland Merit (LLM).
A Private Court or its Judge shall be deemed to have committed a Misdemeanor in cases of:
Negation of the principles of Mutual Recognition or Supreme Court Oversight, with penalties ranging from 500 to 20,000 LLM, contingent upon the motive behind the action and the severity of its impact on the Parties involved.
Non-compliance with other provisions of this Law, with penalties ranging from 250 to 10,000 LLM, based on the gravity of the infraction and its consequences for the Parties.
Persistent non-compliance by a Private Court may lead to its disestablishment. Parties affected by the actions of the said Private Court within the preceding three years are entitled to initiate an appeal process within 20 days following the receipt of notice regarding such disestablishment.
Chapter 10: Final Provisions
